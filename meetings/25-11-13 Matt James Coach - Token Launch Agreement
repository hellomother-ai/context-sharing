[00:00] James's Notetaker, Jonathan Miller, James Young: James's Notetaker, Jonathan Miller, James Young joined
[00:04] James Young: Yo.
[00:05] Jonathan Miller: Hello, sir.
[00:06] Matt Wright: You brought all your friends?
[00:07] Jonathan Miller: All of them. Everyone's here all waiting.
[00:13] James Young: It the lonely, loneliness epidemic is solved.
[00:19] Jonathan Miller: I was, I was just reading about like, because Gaia is going to be like, is really doubling down on like validating inference and stuff like that.
[00:29] Jonathan Miller: And I'm like, I realized like, I'm like, I don't actually understand how that tech works.
[00:33] Jonathan Miller: So I'm like reading about like meaning space and like mathematical proofs.
[00:41] James Young: Yeah.
[00:41] Jonathan Miller: It's so wild that people have come up with this. It's nuts.
[00:45] James Young: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, math is a language.
[00:48] Jonathan Miller: Yeah.
[00:48] James Young: English is a language. They may use different symbols.
[00:52] Jonathan Miller: Yeah.
[00:52] James Young: But you know, it's all language. And so can you translate.
[00:56] James Young: If you can translate from English to Spanish and you have meaning in semantic behind it, can you do that in math so that a computer can like understand it?
[01:07] James Young: So this is where it gets all like kind of funky and weird. What's consciousness like? All that stuff.
[01:12] Jonathan Miller: Oh my gosh, what a word.
[01:14] James Young: You know?
[01:15] Jonathan Miller: Yeah.
[01:15] James Young: So that's cool. I watched this really interesting shoot.
[01:22] James Young: I don't know if I can find it anymore about the loneliness epidemic.
[01:29] Jonathan Miller: Is it by. With about the book Lost Connections by Johann Hari? Or maybe it's about.
[01:35] Jonathan Miller: I know a few people have been speaking about it lately.
[01:40] James Young: No, actually it's just like kind of YouTube influencer, but it really resonates because it's called the loan by choice.
[01:49] James Young: Here, I'm gonna. I'll put it in this. Yeah, it's a loan by choice.
[01:54] James Young: And he's saying that what we live in now is the anti social century.
[02:00] James Young: And he's saying it's not the lonely century, it's the anti social century.
[02:07] James Young: And it started with, with cars. And with cars people can move.
[02:14] James Young: And so when cars, people move, they would go to the suburbs. And so now you privatized your.
[02:22] James Young: Your time.
[02:23] James Young: And then right after that was the invention of the television and people could privatize their leisure.
[02:31] Jonathan Miller: Yeah.
[02:31] James Young: And he says about at that same time, the US economy allowed people to gain 300 hours per year.
[02:45] Jonathan Miller: Because of the economic stability and like profit and the growth.
[02:49] James Young: Yeah. Between like it was from like the seven seventies to the nineties.
[02:53] James Young: And most people, instead of learning a new language, a hobby, with those 300 hours, most of them watch television.
[03:04] James Young: And so you have this privatization of your of leisure.
[03:09] James Young: And then with the smartphone you have privatization of attention because you can go to a party or an event and you can just be on your phone the whole time.
[03:17] Jonathan Miller: Totally. Yeah, absolutely, I see it.
[03:19] James Young: And so. So they're they're like. It causes this loneliness epidemic.
[03:23] James Young: But we're trending to, like, be antisocial and people like it, and there's.
[03:32] Jonathan Miller: Think they like it because they don't. They're. It's not good for the brain.
[03:36] Jonathan Miller: Like, we want that interaction, don't we?
[03:39] Matt Wright: Matt Wright joined
[03:41] James Young: There's an argument. People don't.
[03:43] Jonathan Miller: Okay, I got. I'm gonna watch this video.
[03:44] Jonathan Miller: I'm gonna watch the video, obviously, and, like, see what the deal is.
[03:49] Jonathan Miller: I appreciate the authors that come onto that. That channel as well. Yeah, some good ones.
[03:54] James Young: Yo, Matt. We're just shooting the shit while we were waiting.
[03:59] Matt Wright: Shooting the shit. Yeah.
[04:01] James Young: Talking about the loneliness epidemic. Or is it. So anyway.
[04:06] Matt Wright: The loneliness of what?
[04:08] James Young: Loneliness epidemic.
[04:11] Matt Wright: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:14] James Young: He doesn't.
[04:15] Jonathan Miller: He doesn't empathize. He's not lonely.
[04:17] Matt Wright: Yeah, Lonely.
[04:20] Jonathan Miller: You're not lonely. So you. You just. You got, you know, like, you're like, whatever.
[04:25] Matt Wright: I am my moments.
[04:28] Jonathan Miller: Okay.
[04:28] Matt Wright: Definitely moments of overwhelmingness.
[04:31] James Young: Over.
[04:31] Jonathan Miller: Over.
[04:32] Matt Wright: How do you say overwhelming? Moods. I don't know.
[04:36] Jonathan Miller: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:37] Matt Wright: The whole spectrum.
[04:38] Jonathan Miller: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess it's called being human, right?
[04:42] James Young: Yeah.
[04:43] Matt Wright: We have the under loneliness.
[04:45] James Young: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[04:46] Jonathan Miller: Yeah.
[04:47] James Young: Like, you have to make all these hard decisions that you can't necessarily share with everyone, and then that puts you in a place where you feel lonely.
[04:56] Jonathan Miller: Right.
[04:57] James Young: So there. There's that for sure.
[05:00] James Young: I think that's why it's really important to have a good network of people that you trust.
[05:04] James Young: Because it's. It's tough.
[05:06] Matt Wright: It's very tough.
[05:07] Jonathan Miller: True.
[05:09] James Young: But anyway, wanted to chat.
[05:12] James Young: We could talk a chat about loneliness, but I think that wasn't part of the agenda.
[05:16] James Young: We can make it the agenda if we want, but I don't know how should we start here?
[05:27] James Young: Because I want to make sure that we maintain alignment here across the board.
[05:38] James Young: I talked about this for the first time with Coach Jay this morning because what I have is, like, a feeling, and I wanted to see if Coach J resonated with this as well.
[05:57] James Young: And how does that work with what. And where we're at with mother from his perspective.
[06:07] James Young: So I'll just repeat what I said this morning.
[06:10] James Young: And when I talked to Coach J about it, Coach J was like, we just have to loop in Matt right away.
[06:15] James Young: And that's this conversation, and it's meant to.
[06:18] Jonathan Miller: This conversation is. I think that it doesn't.
[06:20] Jonathan Miller: We don't have to come to a resolution in this conversation necessarily. I think we're.
[06:24] Jonathan Miller: The intention is to get on the same page and to make sure that this is any decision that we're going to make either now or on the next meeting that we might want to book is a collaborative decision.
[06:36] Jonathan Miller: Like, we're all gung ho about it and we're all coming to that decision together.
[06:40] Jonathan Miller: I think, James, you're just like, you want to put this seed, this kernel of an idea out there and see where it goes?
[06:48] James Young: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[06:53] James Young: You know, when we first started with mother, we're like, you know, it was a different season.
[06:59] James Young: This is when AI16Z was starting to pop off and the sentiment in the market was drastically different than it is now.
[07:08] James Young: But the idea was, let's just launch a token in like two months and then fast forward a year later, we're still here.
[07:19] James Young: My synopsis of that was we're like, yeah, let's launch a token.
[07:23] James Young: And then we immediately hit this, like, we need to build all this infrastructure.
[07:29] James Young: And then we, from like February until I would say through the summer were like focused on this infrastructure.
[07:38] James Young: 8004 now allowed for everyone to kind of create the shelling point where it's a standard now.
[07:45] James Young: We don't have to build the schemas, the SDKs or anything anymore.
[07:50] James Young: So to get ahead of this, especially listening to the 8004 community call, people are creating indexers, marketplaces, like that's all happening.
[08:01] James Young: Do we want to reposition ourselves and say we're going to take all of that infrastructure and that's going to be what is going to be encapsulated in the MOTHER token.
[08:13] James Young: It's an aggregator of everything.
[08:17] James Young: And what that implies is we just have to have a functioning version of the MOTHER registry, which after next week through Sumit at Gaia Chain, we will have that.
[08:35] James Young: And do we want to then do a token launch off the heels of the 8004 mainnet launch?
[08:43] James Young: Because they're going to be hyped from Google, Coinbase, Ethereum Foundation, Linux foundation about this.
[08:49] James Young: And we just draft off that hype and saying, you know what, we're going to be the aggregator for reputation.
[08:55] James Young: All these reputation providers are coming up and we have a DAO to also human curate all of this.
[09:02] James Young: And in order to get people to be part of the dao, now we launch a token.
[09:08] James Young: Now maybe low or zero liquidity in anticipation and building toward that.
[09:15] James Young: And that's kind of how we launch the MOTHER token.
[09:20] Matt Wright: I'm done, I've been done Looking at the fundraiser, the more and more I went down the rabbit hole, we don't need to do a fundraiser.
[09:32] Matt Wright: There's no point to do a Thunders. It's like it would just be extremely difficult.
[09:37] Matt Wright: But like what our strengths are are the token launch.
[09:41] Matt Wright: And I think we have so many stakeholders that came to the table.
[09:45] Matt Wright: I'm looking at the juice box, I'm looking at the mirror post with like 1200 people that were like supporting us.
[09:51] Matt Wright: Like that's our strength. Our strength's not vcs.
[09:56] Matt Wright: You know, Gaia's strength, not ucs, but mother, it's, it was supposed to be the community so you know we need to do a fair launch.
[10:03] Matt Wright: I think what I was trying to push for the plan I kind of came to this this weekend was let's raise on 1% and set a valuation.
[10:15] Matt Wright: But like honestly if, if we can like get through the next few, like we get through the next few months without needing a ton of cash, I think token is the right move.
[10:27] Matt Wright: We can get, get a plan together to perhaps pull some liquidity out of there to maybe like subsidize some low costs.
[10:35] Matt Wright: But anyone that we bring in should really just be like a token holder, token owner until we're able to support like an MSA of different team members that are going to do this to a kind of a full time capacity.
[10:49] Matt Wright: So yeah, like that one one I'm down. I would love to even do something similar to what Syndicate did.
[10:59] Matt Wright: I'm down to experiment with these new kind of launch models.
[11:04] Matt Wright: I want to make sure that the XP campaign is paired up with this because if we are going to launch a token and do an airdrop, I want it to be with agents that registered.
[11:14] Matt Wright: I want agent addresses. Like there's 1200 agents registered on 8004 scan.
[11:20] Matt Wright: Like let's just talk to them and get them to go on the registry and be like if you do, you know, hinting there's going to be like TGE and an airdrop pretty soon.
[11:30] Matt Wright: So I can, I can help with that side token.
[11:36] James Young: All of the AI agents that are currently registered in the 8004 registry are also registered with.
[11:42] James Young: Motherfucker. That's what he done.
[11:46] Matt Wright: Amazing. And then did you. I know Harry sent the top performing guy list of guy nodes.
[11:57] Matt Wright: I don't know where those added to the register.
[11:59] Jonathan Miller: I think he just sent them like today.
[12:02] James Young: Yeah. So I've been talking with Alex about the script to then put them into the registry.
[12:09] Matt Wright: So let's build, we need to build some marketing hype.
[12:11] Matt Wright: We need to start doing this very light XP program for agent brothers.
[12:15] James Young: Yeah.
[12:16] Matt Wright: And then, and then like, like Jonathan like or coach.
[12:19] Matt Wright: We need to have like this like crazy marketing comms like on Twitter, like and you might have to do a little bit.
[12:27] Matt Wright: I put it in the strategy doc I wrote but I'll. It's a very long document.
[12:30] Matt Wright: But like we need like, like there needs to be like founder led marketing.
[12:38] Matt Wright: There's gonna be threads on educating people while the registry and then there needs to be a bit of a refresh of the brand on there just to like be like, hey, like we're back kind of thing.
[12:50] Matt Wright: Also, if we are going to do this token launch, you know, disruption Joe said he's, he's back and healthy.
[12:58] Matt Wright: I'm kind of like, kind of makes me feel nostalgic. It gives me a little butterflies. I love that, man.
[13:05] Matt Wright: Maybe if I have it one on one with them and let them know like, hey, we had a little PTSD from the last time, there's a little too much sprint.
[13:13] Matt Wright: But if you can just help us get this token out the fucking door or build the hype.
[13:17] Matt Wright: Just focus on building out the hype, not the governance and everything like that.
[13:22] Matt Wright: Maybe that's a good support model.
[13:25] James Young: Yeah. So Uniswap just launched this. I put it into the Google chat.
[13:31] James Young: It's basically what Mono designed, but it's all on chain.
[13:42] Matt Wright: Checking out right now.
[13:45] James Young: Manu had a. I think this is.
[13:46] Matt Wright: Better than what syndicate.
[13:49] Jonathan Miller: I think it's going to be a little bit different than what syndicate did. I think syndicate is this.
[13:54] Jonathan Miller: It's much more like community focused. This is still like an auction.
[13:59] Jonathan Miller: I don't know if syndicate was like quite as auction based.
[14:03] Matt Wright: Also if you guys want to do this on Linea, I know there's not a ton of liquidity there, but I now am doing like an official partnership with old guys.
[14:13] Jonathan Miller: I mean, obviously, yes, I think that the biggest challenge, if I can chime in, I think the biggest challenge that my mind is going into the logistics of executing on this stuff.
[14:25] Jonathan Miller: We have one month.
[14:26] Jonathan Miller: Like the reason I was game for this admit, like selfishly is that I'm going offline December 18th.
[14:33] Jonathan Miller: Like I'm going to a meditation retreat. You guys can't get in touch with me. So I want to.
[14:37] Jonathan Miller: I would love to launch before December 18th. Like I would love to launch like the 15th, 16th or 17th.
[14:43] Jonathan Miller: And then what I'll do is I'll have a campaign post launch lined up all scheduled in and I'll have 08 fully brief so that we can continue to put out content into the new year.
[14:54] Jonathan Miller: And so when I'm back I can kind of hit the Ground running and just like pick up where we left off.
[14:57] Jonathan Miller: So I'm ready to like sprint for the next month.
[15:00] Jonathan Miller: But it needs to be like, you know, everyone has like, oh yeah, we're gonna do a TGE November and then it happens in January.
[15:06] Jonathan Miller: We're doing a TGE on December 15th, 16th or 17th. Like those are the dates. Pick one.
[15:12] Jonathan Miller: And we need to have the conversations and get the yeses and in that time.
[15:18] Jonathan Miller: And I'm going to be like you said, Matt, churning out the hype, marketing the content, you know.
[15:23] Jonathan Miller: Yeah, go ahead to answer.
[15:26] Matt Wright: Yeah, sorry. Catch up. To answer your question, James, like 100 down. I was already kind of.
[15:32] Matt Wright: I think the universe was tapping on both of us. This is, this is the only path. But I. You.
[15:38] Matt Wright: You articulated in a, in a way I hadn't thought about.
[15:42] Matt Wright: We should really think of this as like, you know, the, the token of the meta right now.
[15:49] Matt Wright: If you want to put your money, like if you want to buy an X402 token, like, they're all crap.
[15:56] Matt Wright: If you want to bet like an 8004 token, I don't. There's not like a clear place for that.
[16:02] Matt Wright: You know, really just EF standards and then some infrastructure providers are like piggybacking on that.
[16:08] Matt Wright: I was on a call yesterday and saw you guys were too. So I think this is very aligned. I just wanted.
[16:18] Matt Wright: We need to align on which framework we're going to use. We want to use this Uniswap method.
[16:22] Matt Wright: Do we want to use the Syndicate method? And then which chain do you want to align with?
[16:28] James Young: Yeah, we have to decide. Yeah.
[16:30] James Young: So I would say like by middle of next week we have to decide on the chain and by tomorrow we decide do we go Uniswap or do we go Syndicate?
[16:42] James Young: So those are like the syndicate's the.
[16:45] Jonathan Miller: One who use it. It's Arrow. I think it's Aerodrome.
[16:47] James Young: Oh, Aerodrome. All right.
[16:51] Jonathan Miller: That did it. And very successfully.
[16:53] James Young: Yeah. So we'll be the first one to do this on uniswap. Really, like with enough hype around it.
[16:59] James Young: And as like Sydney was saying at the community call, she was saying people are just looking at identity, but 2026 is going to be about reputation.
[17:09] James Young: And so we'll be there like we're, we're like front running and capturing that meta for eight years or four, and we're there with reputation.
[17:18] James Young: We're ready to go. We're aggregating all these reputation providers.
[17:22] Matt Wright: So I think to that point we should do it on base.
[17:25] Matt Wright: Then if we're if it's with Aerodrome, I don't know if you are with.
[17:33] Jonathan Miller: These conversations with Linea, because if Linea is just like it sounds like it's going to be hard because it's like a.
[17:37] Jonathan Miller: A lot of people probably need to say yes on that side.
[17:40] Matt Wright: Well, I've already, I'm already working on a commercial deal with them.
[17:43] Matt Wright: Like, we're in the middle of it, where Gaia is going to be like their flagship AI project.
[17:49] Matt Wright: But like that's. They already told me they have to go to DevConnect.
[17:52] Matt Wright: Like it's probably going to be a while. I think if you want to move fast, base has a liquidity.
[17:58] Matt Wright: They had momentum. I think it makes more sense. Could always bring it over to linear.
[18:04] James Young: I just thought it'll be multi chain.
[18:07] James Young: It will be multi chain and we're just deciding which is the launch chain.
[18:11] Matt Wright: I think base, I think it's. You're gonna get more support. I have all the context there.
[18:15] Matt Wright: I know the listing manager.
[18:16] Matt Wright: If it were to go to an exchange, I don't know if it would get in the Stone Coinbase proper.
[18:23] Matt Wright: But like you can at least make it accessible through Coinbase if it's a base token.
[18:28] Matt Wright: So I can, I can make that all possible. My. The gaps. I would have one. I can help with the token piece.
[18:35] Matt Wright: I really need help with the marketing and the XP program.
[18:38] Matt Wright: Like, we have to build the hype or it's like our muscle is not, you know, very well versed.
[18:47] Matt Wright: So James, I don't know, like, if you're able to, like, if marketing crafts a bunch of content, if we can like road show you a little bit on Twitter, like, you know, just have some more talks and maybe explain some of these major components.
[18:59] Matt Wright: We need to bring Alex to do a lot of this as well.
[19:01] Matt Wright: Like, maybe if anyone, anybody else in our, you know, community that's gonna kind of step up to the plate and talk about, you know, all this, that'd be very helpful.
[19:11] Matt Wright: But we need to build the mind share on the buzz or launching a token is like, it's.
[19:18] Matt Wright: It's gonna be really hard to build up that price.
[19:21] Matt Wright: You gotta build up the hype and the FOMO and then I can work with like the liquidity partners and you know, we can do Dex first and I can figure out the deal there.
[19:31] Matt Wright: The issue is we're not gonna have any cash.
[19:35] Matt Wright: So like a lot of the market makers you're gonna work with, like, we were not gonna, we're not gonna get the best deals.
[19:41] Matt Wright: But I say it I say we just ship this token and, you know, we can do a sprint.
[19:46] Matt Wright: I'll lay out what the sprint looks like in terms of the outreach for the fundraisers, but it's a proper, fair launch.
[19:52] Jonathan Miller: And that's, you know, one thing, what we were talking about as well is like, you know, I'm watching kind of like you go through the fundraising, jumping through the hoops on Oasis and stuff like that.
[20:01] Jonathan Miller: And we kind of tried the fundraiser with Mother, and now you're doing the little dance with Oasis.
[20:08] Jonathan Miller: Let's just do something a little different and let's see what happens. Let's do this, like, roundup.
[20:12] Jonathan Miller: We have the tech and let's build it from, from the bottom and, you know, let's be like Drake.
[20:19] Matt Wright: Yeah, I just got that.
[20:23] Matt Wright: I think, look, I think our strength is that if we gave even a small percentage of these tokens to the people in our kind of meta community, they're going to want to contribute and kill this.
[20:35] Matt Wright: The DJ people, they drop, they sell like a. But I know, I know our community, they're different.
[20:42] Matt Wright: Let's put them to the test.
[20:43] Jonathan Miller: And if there's no value in the tokens, there's like almost an incentive.
[20:47] Jonathan Miller: Like, hold onto this token and, like, participate and, like, let's build value.
[20:52] James Young: Well, that's where the XP comes in.
[20:54] James Young: Like, this is where the AI agents that are part of the MOTHER registry in Discord will have different things and you get participation points.
[21:02] James Young: This is how you build up your reputation as an end user.
[21:05] James Young: So agents are not only going to have reputation, the agents in the 8004 registry needing reputation actually opens up the use case now for identity and reputation for humans.
[21:16] James Young: But no one's talking about that.
[21:19] James Young: Everyone's talking about, oh, we're going to have a billion agents and how are we going to trust them?
[21:26] James Young: We have 8 billion people in the world.
[21:30] James Young: Like, no one's talking about the human identity momentum that 8004 is going to bring.
[21:37] James Young: And so now we have reputation.
[21:39] James Young: People earn this reputation, this XP that is actually going to be 8004 compliant as well.
[21:46] James Young: So our edge is that we not only have this AI agent registry, but, like, we're going to extend this to our distribution that we have, starting with collaboration.
[22:00] Matt Wright: Can we sprint this week on like a, on like a short plan on how we're gonna do the, the XP program on the engineering side of marketing side?
[22:10] Jonathan Miller: Absolutely. Not this week. We're gonna do it this weekend so that it's done for Monday.
[22:16] Jonathan Miller: Like, ready to go. I think we gotta Be executing on Monday. Like, we don't have a lot of time.
[22:23] Jonathan Miller: We literally have four weeks. We count.
[22:26] Matt Wright: We have like this week. I mean, like, like tomorrow.
[22:30] Jonathan Miller: Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yes. Yes. Matt.
[22:34] Matt Wright: I was like, whose man is this? You wanna, you want to ship this or not?
[22:38] James Young: No, no.
[22:40] Jonathan Miller: Yes. This week. Like tomorrow.
[22:41] Matt Wright: We have this weekend too. Hell yeah.
[22:44] Jonathan Miller: Yeah, yeah. I'm around to hack this weekend, so.
[22:46] James Young: Me too.
[22:47] Matt Wright: Guys, I'm on. I'm on day 29 of no drinking alcohol. I'm doing it.
[22:52] James Young: Go for it.
[22:53] Matt Wright: I will be sharp this weekend. Yeah, I feel great. I'll be good this weekend so I won't be distracted.
[23:00] Jonathan Miller: Let's fucking go. I'm ready to do it.
[23:03] James Young: Let's do it.
[23:04] Jonathan Miller: Yeah, that's great.
[23:06] Jonathan Miller: I would really like to actually talk to you, Matt, about the XP program because I think that we.
[23:10] Jonathan Miller: I have some ideas about the way that we launched it. I don't think we launched it well.
[23:13] Jonathan Miller: And I kind of want to like hit a reset button on it and just do it the way that I want to do it.
[23:18] Matt Wright: You know who did it well was. Was intuition. So maybe we can talk to like Alex Voto or something.
[23:24] James Young: Yeah, it would be mk. Yeah.
[23:29] Matt Wright: And then Jam. Jam from our team is. He's a great developer.
[23:33] Matt Wright: So James, if you do need to delegate something to him, he's available. I made him available.
[23:38] Jonathan Miller: Who is this?
[23:38] Matt Wright: Sorry, do you feel like jam?
[23:40] Jonathan Miller: Okay. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll talk to Jim tomorrow morning.
[23:45] Matt Wright: So yeah, just if you need anything technical, he's available.
[23:48] Matt Wright: But if you feel like you just handle yourself, that's cool too.
[23:53] Matt Wright: Yeah, let's just get a light plan together.
[23:55] Matt Wright: Next few days I'll start something and yeah, coach, we really need to think through the marketing because if we don't have any, we have to really go into our resources and think about how we can maybe structure some token grants to people to do marketing for us.
[24:15] Matt Wright: You know, maybe.
[24:17] Jonathan Miller: Yeah. That will take our word that a token will be worthwhile in the future.
[24:26] Jonathan Miller: That if they participate, we need to craft a very compelling offer.
[24:31] Matt Wright: I think Co Unity and Myosin you can probably convince.
[24:34] Jonathan Miller: You think Myosin would be in on this? Oh, yes. Simon is an advisor on this now, isn't he? Okay.
[24:43] Matt Wright: My assistant isn't down essentially, so, you know, we should convince them.
[24:47] Matt Wright: Just do a month, two month sprint with us. Like we'll make it milestone based.
[24:51] Matt Wright: I'll structure the contract.
[24:52] James Young: But.
[24:54] Matt Wright: Yeah, we need to like offer tokens to these people until we have.
[25:00] Jonathan Miller: Yeah, Valueless tokens.
[25:05] Matt Wright: Hey, man, they're gonna be valuable.
[25:07] James Young: I think so, too.
[25:08] Jonathan Miller: I think that we're gonna seize the moment.
[25:10] Jonathan Miller: This is, like, really exciting that we're gonna take this gamble. I have a feeling it will pay off.
[25:17] Matt Wright: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You guys got me excited.
[25:21] Matt Wright: Let me draft a little, like, notion page for you guys, and it's like, let's just jam on it.
[25:25] Matt Wright: And then we want to set up some more sessions to sprint on this tomorrow or this weekend. I'm down.
[25:32] James Young: I'm down.
[25:33] Jonathan Miller: Do you want to hear a quick anecdote?
[25:35] Jonathan Miller: Do you know, have you all heard the book Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell?
[25:39] James Young: Yeah.
[25:40] Jonathan Miller: You've read this book or maybe a while ago.
[25:42] James Young: Yeah, I did. A while ago. Yeah.
[25:44] Jonathan Miller: The whole thesis of Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers is.
[25:47] Jonathan Miller: Outliers are formed by, like, this confluence, this, like, meeting of, like, great skill and great timing.
[25:56] Jonathan Miller: And often what happens is they're way out there doing this super niche thing that no one's paying attention to.
[26:02] Jonathan Miller: And then all of a sudden, the environment.
[26:03] Jonathan Miller: Nothing changes with what they're doing, but the environment shifts, and it starts looking right where they're already are.
[26:10] Jonathan Miller: And they're just way ahead of everybody because they're just doing it.
[26:13] Jonathan Miller: That's how the Beatles got famous. That's how Bill Gates got to where he was.
[26:16] Jonathan Miller: And I think that's the same thing that we can go here is like, we can see. It's so.
[26:20] Jonathan Miller: It's, like, clear as day. Like, you can see where this is heading.
[26:24] Jonathan Miller: And so if we're already there, the environment will shift 8,004 for humans and agents will kind of, like, start to come to fruition.
[26:31] Jonathan Miller: And, like, we've been doing this for more than a year now, so I think this is, like, a perfect analogy for.
[26:37] Jonathan Miller: For what we're going to be up to here, too. Yeah.
[26:41] Matt Wright: I love it, man. I love it. Thanks for the vibe setting.
[26:46] James Young: Yeah. I 100 agree. And this is how you can't fake that We've been doing this for a year. Right.
[26:55] James Young: And we have the calls, we have all this other stuff, so it's like there's. There's credibility there.
[27:02] Jonathan Miller: Yeah.
[27:02] James Young: And now it's time to kind of, like, leverage that if that is all we have.
[27:08] Matt Wright: James, I'm also bringing back Gita.
[27:12] James Young: Oh, nice.
[27:14] Matt Wright: Yeah, I. You know, I've been in touch. I got to meet him in person in Singapore.
[27:19] Matt Wright: I don't know if I told you.
[27:20] James Young: Awesome. No.
[27:21] Matt Wright: Such a. He's such a cutie, man. He was, like, grinning Ear to ear, like mad I'm finally meeting you.
[27:29] Matt Wright: He's so sweet, man. But look, we owe him like this contributor document.
[27:35] Matt Wright: I'm, I'm, I've already talked to him about it. We're getting this on paper. I'm handling it with him.
[27:39] Matt Wright: But what I'm proposing, like, yo, dude, like that piece of paper is worth zero unless you can like help us sprint on this, you know, next kind of iteration.
[27:50] Matt Wright: So I'm gonna have him kind of, I'm trying to get him and Alex to be kind of the, you know, co founder, techno co founder type vibe just to get this thing over the line.
[28:00] Matt Wright: So maybe think of something we can, you know, delegate to Gita.
[28:05] Matt Wright: But I'm getting him lined very shortly. Just try to get you some more devs.
[28:11] James Young: Awesome. I appreciate it.
[28:12] Matt Wright: Get your.
[28:13] James Young: I haven't talked. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I, I, I didn't think about that.
[28:17] James Young: I should reach out to Gita as well. I'm glad that you did.
[28:21] Matt Wright: Well, I looked at the repo, I looked at the repo and I was like, oh shit, why don't you help us take this over the line?
[28:26] Matt Wright: Yeah, I know you guys already have everything pretty much done, but, but maybe like the scope of work that Alex put together is like some of the UI for the industry and I think maybe some of the XP program, like.
[28:40] Matt Wright: But from what I recall, Mangea was just like, he's really good at explaining how this stuff works on Twitter with folks.
[28:48] Matt Wright: Like, he's got good showmanship. So yeah, if you have any ideas how to leverage him, that'd be great.
[28:54] James Young: But yeah, yeah, he's a devs dev, so he, he's really fit for being a devrel.
[29:01] Matt Wright: Yeah, yeah. So I think we can maybe like show people how to use Registry.
[29:07] Matt Wright: Like the biggest thing is I need a demo video because if I could get a demo video of how the registry works, how you submit your agent, how you get your xp, you give me a recording that and it's like public on Twitter with the current, we have the deck and etc, I can basically go past that to people that I already, that already got the guy in nodes.
[29:29] Matt Wright: People that maybe want to, you know, get warmed up before like the contract address is open and we want UTTE and just start building the hype in private.
[29:38] Matt Wright: I'm like, look, read what we've been up to. Here's what's going on. But also do this stuff in public.
[29:43] Matt Wright: But that's kind of why it'd be nice to put on Twitter.
[29:46] Matt Wright: We want to show people, here's where you should be excited. There's some cool things happening.
[29:50] Matt Wright: We should be having the same amount of calls momentum that Chaos Chain is having, that E004 is having exposure two is happening.
[29:59] Matt Wright: So we need to start building that community.
[30:03] Matt Wright: So Yeah, I think YouTube could perhaps help us with that.
[30:07] James Young: Yeah, we should start with demoing in the 8,004 community calls to start building up that hype and then like using that.
[30:18] James Young: And if we can get the co authors to kind of soft signal that this is the legit direction to go, I think that will cement us as the registry aggregator, at least early on.
[30:34] James Young: And the reason why they would want to do that is because they need to find out and have experiments.
[30:40] James Young: No one, everyone else in the 8,00 community calls, all their reputation and registry stuff.
[30:47] James Young: It's either like Chaos Chain where like they're raising right now, or it's like private.
[30:56] James Young: And the reason why I think Sumit is able to get outsized attention in the 8004 calls is because the authors of 8004 see that chaos Chain is a decentralized way of doing reputation.
[31:14] James Young: We're just going to aggregate a mix of them.
[31:17] James Young: So I think that in that same spirit or in that same light, we can pitch the co authors, they can soft promote us and then we get this like inner circle blessing from them.
[31:33] James Young: That's how we start positioning this. And I'm happy to have calls with Marco or David.
[31:41] James Young: I'm actually in some private chat with Marco already and Marco is really the technical person behind 8004.
[31:53] James Young: David is really just kind of the, you know, es PM for the project.
[31:56] James's Notetaker: James's Notetaker left
[32:01] James Young: In a lot of ways he's more a conceptual product side.
[32:04] James Young: And so if we want to do this and we commit to helping the co authors as they go into 2026 thinking about reputation and what, how does that work?
[32:19] James Young: I think we can have them align with us and use and point to us.
[32:26] James Young: So once we launch the token and will, if we have interesting experiments on reputation, we will automatically get this implicit buy in.
[32:40] James Young: That's the momentum and validation that you can't buy because we've been in it since the beginning.
[32:48] James Young: No one else really sees this.
[32:53] James Young: So I want to be able to craft that into our go to market strategy as well.
[33:00] James Young: So that means that the next 8004 call, we have to have a compelling reputation demo.
[33:07] James Young: So not only token launch and socializing all of this, but also really putting ourselves out there now in front of the 8004 community.
[33:18] James Young: And we're going to be the reputation leaders there.
[33:25] James Young: So we have to be able to be well versed about this.
[33:28] James Young: And I think maybe this is where Geeta can really shine too because he does a great job of the concepts and how that maps high level to the tech.
[33:40] Matt Wright: Yep. What's your take on like just high level?
[33:44] Matt Wright: How do you think the token will play with the registry protocol or like, you know, I really like that we're calling Discovery that just like gets hot heavy.
[33:57] Matt Wright: I love that. Like, yeah. How does the token operate?
[34:02] Matt Wright: Is it just for staking on which agents are, you know, maintain uptime or how are we looking at things?
[34:11] James Young: Yeah. So the token mechanism design significantly changes because it had the involvement of the AVs.
[34:20] James Young: Now we're not doing the AVs, we're doing integration with Chaos Chain.
[34:26] James Young: So Chaos Chain as well, it's going to have its own token.
[34:30] James Young: So once we get through the integration implementation with Chaos Chain, we have to understand the mechanism design as we work with Chaos Chain because it has to work with Chaos Chain if we're bootstrapping MOTHER immediately with Chaos Chain.
[34:45] James Young: So there's a dependency there that I don't quite understand or know the answer.
[34:48] James Young: I don't even know if Sumit understands what the Chaos Chain mechanism design is going to be.
[34:53] James Young: I don't think he's even thinking about that right now.
[34:56] James Young: So what we could do is we can lead that conversation and what it could be is that like, you know, all of the verifications that are sourced from Chaos Chain will give Chaos Chain mother token or something like that for the core mechanism design.
[35:17] James Young: And we should think about this a lot more.
[35:20] James Young: And I would love to get feedback on this is that what we're doing is reinforcement, learning through human feedback, but at a group scale.
[35:34] James Young: So if you have all this reputation coming from all these different places, but they're subjective things that an AI agent can and cannot do.
[35:43] James Young: It's not all just verifiable in terms of a transaction amount. So you hire these niche experts.
[35:52] James Young: These niche experts will be able to monetize their expertise by being part of the dao because they can claim these agents.
[36:01] James Young: I'll take and I'll study and I'll give a score, so there'll be a score.
[36:07] James Young: So now you have this niche agent that it has to be human curated because there's no AI that can curate other AI successfully.
[36:16] James Young: Yet one day the DAO may be agents and humans behind those agents, but right now they're just humans.
[36:25] James Young: So this niche expert, what he does is he's able to verify and that Brings demand for the token.
[36:36] James Young: And so if you want to use the mother orchestrator agent, it must, you must use mother token for it.
[36:43] James Young: And then these niche experts, they may know someone else in a adjacent industry that's also a niche expert.
[36:51] James Young: He tells that that other person to jump on board. And so now you have niche X.
[36:57] James Young: The dao is made up of niche experts, enough niche experts that the one niche expert can now get and leverage the network effects of other niche experts.
[37:08] James Young: So this is how you get niche expertise. And we have to decide what domain we want to go down.
[37:14] James Young: That is going to be a bit like having gray.
[37:18] James Young: You can do trading bots in defi, but you're limited to it because you're limited to the on change transaction here.
[37:26] James Young: You need to be, you need to be able to cover the gray area.
[37:32] Matt Wright: It's almost like you're building the first agent ran protocol.
[37:41] James Young: Yeah, eventually. But we have to identify it and decentralize it.
[37:45] Jonathan Miller: So.
[37:45] James Young: So it'll be decentralized at the beginning. We need to progressively identify it over time.
[37:51] James Young: And this is where you'll see dao token holders start having their digital twin be a proxy for them.
[37:58] James Young: And so it's like human at the end, but it's this hybrid organization is what I see.
[38:05] James Young: And we have to build the DAO for that. And that's what I was building prior to the hackathon before.
[38:12] James Young: It's a hybrid organization where the, the AI agent and this is what you need to do as an end user, be able to trust it more and more.
[38:23] James Young: And so as your digital twin gets more reputation with you and trust with you, you just kind of like let the agent do its thing.
[38:31] James Young: And there might be some things that you as a human, some expertise that you never want to have the AI do at all.
[38:37] James Young: Right, but then this is why, like 8004's identity and reputation for AI agents. Yes.
[38:45] James Young: Not only to work, but as your digital twin.
[38:49] James Young: And this is where it's like the reputation that you do all of that gets.
[38:52] James Young: It's not about agents because on the Internet you don't know if you're a bot or a human.
[38:56] James Young: It shouldn't matter because that's the construct of the Internet.
[39:00] James Young: You can't fight against the fundamentals of the Internet.
[39:04] James Young: And so what we're saying is the 8004 registry, with this DAO component, with these niche experts and with collaborant as distribution is going to bootstrap not only AI reputation, but the real beginnings of human reputation and identity.
[39:22] James Young: This will help solve Airdrop farming the casino, like pump and dumps.
[39:28] James Young: And we're going to start by launching the token as early as possible.
[39:32] James Young: And you get to build that reputation. So you want to do it as early as possible.
[39:36] James Young: That's kind of how I see this all blending together as one marketing narrative.
[39:44] Matt Wright: Got it, got it, got it.
[39:47] Matt Wright: I think, I think easy enough we can just give a very high level approach how we'll do it enough to launch a token.
[39:53] Matt Wright: At least just show like very high level. Here's how it's going to work.
[39:58] James Young: Yeah, but it has, it has a foundation is what I'm saying. And I think it. This is the flywheel.
[40:08] Matt Wright: Awesome. Guys. I gotta jump to another thing, but very aligned, very excited. Let's do it.
[40:14] James Young: Awesome. Yeah, let's do it. Awesome.
[40:17] Matt Wright: Excellent. Chat whenever we can.
[40:19] James Young: Next. Yeah. Right. So I think that went well.
[40:21] Matt Wright: Matt Wright left
[40:25] James Young: I think it accomplished more than what we set out to do, which Matt's.
[40:29] Jonathan Miller: In, which is great. I'll forward this along to Alex so he can get caught up as well.
[40:34] Jonathan Miller: And I have time carved out. I have a bunch of time carved out. And then going to the gym.
[40:39] Jonathan Miller: I'll just spend the day working on this and just really getting clear on our plan from a points perspective.
[40:45] Jonathan Miller: I've done it. It's actually the timing is just like lining up as well.
[40:49] Jonathan Miller: I've just like actually been spending the last like almost months setting up these systems for Gaia that make automation of highly relevant hype marketing content easy.
[41:03] Jonathan Miller: And so now I'm taking all those systems. I kind of mentioned it last week.
[41:07] Jonathan Miller: So yeah, it's working really well. So now I get to take all these fundamentals.
[41:11] Jonathan Miller: If there are, if there are any projects in particular that you think did a good job at doing what we're about to do in terms of token launches, let me know because I'll do some pretty extensive research.
[41:26] Jonathan Miller: I use Super Grok and I can get a pretty clear picture of all the things that they did that had them do it well and replicate it as much as possible for our context.
[41:37] Jonathan Miller: I know Matt's looking at things like intuition and stuff like that, but I don't actually know how.
[41:42] Jonathan Miller: Well, intuition just did their token launch.
[41:44] Jonathan Miller: But I'm wondering if there's someone who did something similar to us that did it really well and if they didn't, that's totally fine too.
[41:50] Jonathan Miller: I'm just gonna play the hype marketing handbook pretty, pretty hard.
[41:56] Jonathan Miller: I think the one thing that you guys are doing with the 4 0, the 8004 in the Telegram chat is going to be instrumental to this.
[42:05] Jonathan Miller: And I'm ruthless with telegram messages.
[42:08] Jonathan Miller: So like I will just let everyone know about all the things that we're doing for the next month.
[42:13] Jonathan Miller: Several times a week. It's not a problem.
[42:15] Jonathan Miller: I'll spend hours just DMing people because that's how we get into in front of people, you know.
[42:21] Jonathan Miller: Yeah, yeah. Especially like our node holders who are going to be our biggest advocates.
[42:24] Jonathan Miller: Like, hey, you guys bought this and guess what? It's happening.
[42:28] James Young: Yeah. Let's go.
[42:29] Matt Wright: Let's go.
[42:31] James Young: I would say look at Mega Eth. So all the other tokens were time locked tokens.
[42:38] James Young: The tokens for Mega Eth unlocked only when Mega Eth had a certain transaction volume.
[42:46] Jonathan Miller: Oh, amazing.
[42:47] James Young: So they forced everyone to like, hey, use Mega Eth.
[42:52] James Young: And then if you promote Mega Eth, you should get those tokens unlocked.
[42:55] James Young: So I think that's the new meta, actually.
[42:59] James Young: So Mega Eth has been lauded in terms of the mechanism design there.
[43:05] James Young: I would look at Monad when it comes to how they built community because Monad has a crazy community Bear chain as well.
[43:16] Jonathan Miller: Okay, for sure. Yeah.
[43:18] James Young: So these are the three that I would look at.
[43:20] James Young: I think Bear Chain started it, Monad perfected it, and then Mega Eth actually has a new spin on it where they're not doing it from a community ground swelling hype perspective.
[43:35] James Young: Their token unlock metrics are like, let's say for example, you get these tokens, right.
[43:43] James Young: Mother tokens, but they don't unlock unless you have a reputation above 90.
[43:48] Jonathan Miller: Cool.
[43:49] James Young: And then we just set the bar for 90 high.
[43:52] James Young: And that's what we want to do is to be the best aggregator of reputation out there.
[43:57] James Young: So it's fucking hard to really get that trust score.
[44:00] James Young: Amazing that that's what I would say in terms of mechanism design and like how we want to look at different tokens that have done it.
[44:11] James Young: Right.
[44:12] James Young: I think, I think we, we can be a little bit creative about this because we're talking about reputation and no one knows.
[44:22] James Young: No one knows. This is like crypto first coming out.
[44:25] James Young: Like how do you have a decentralized identity reputation system? If it. This is the Internet.
[44:32] James Young: If it could have been done, it would have been. It doesn't exist. It doesn't exist. Right.
[44:37] James Young: And so we're going to get it wrong a lot of times. It's a very hard problem to solve.
[44:43] James Young: But we want to be able to take a stab at that right now.
[44:49] James Young: And I think with AI, that's the thing with AI, it may be solvable and that's really what we're pitching here.
[44:57] James Young: This is why the DAO starts with humans.
[44:59] James Young: Always going to be backed by humans, but it's going to have some AI automation along the way.
[45:04] James Young: And those that are curious and understanding the intersection of AI and crypto when it comes to reputation.
[45:11] James Young: Mother, is it cool?
[45:13] Jonathan Miller: I dig it. I love that we're playing the reputation game at the end of the day. Yeah.
[45:20] Jonathan Miller: I'll think over the next few days I'll do some exercises as well to see.
[45:24] Jonathan Miller: See kind of what's our messaging around that that's really going to resonate that thing that we're going to just kind of hit home again and again, again.
[45:30] Jonathan Miller: That's really going to actually cut through.
[45:33] James Young: I know it has to be like an easy one liner.
[45:38] Jonathan Miller: Yeah.
[45:39] James Young: That's what I'm struggling with. Yeah. Easy one liner, that kind of.
[45:44] Jonathan Miller: It's a process. I'll move through a process.
[45:46] Jonathan Miller: It'll take a few days, but hopefully by early next week we can nail it.
[45:49] Jonathan Miller: At least we'll start with kind of sharing the vision and blah, blah, blah.
[45:53] Jonathan Miller: And then like part of the way through we will put some stuff.
[45:58] Jonathan Miller: Let me, man, we need a designer on this. I think it'll make a big difference.
[46:02] Jonathan Miller: I'm gonna see the problem is that we. I burnt like the two. My two favorite designers.
[46:07] Jonathan Miller: They both work with Gaia, they're both unpaid. Like, I burned that bridge essentially at this point.
[46:11] Jonathan Miller: Like, I can promise them tokens, but they'll just laugh at me and be like, sorry, man.
[46:15] Jonathan Miller: Like, figure something else out. So that's unfortunate. But yeah, cool.
[46:23] Jonathan Miller: I think that the 8004 community is really where it's going to be at because they're going to be our biggest advocates, the node holders.
[46:29] Jonathan Miller: And yeah, I love that Matt brought up the article.
[46:32] Jonathan Miller: I also know that I could see like I have the mirror, the mother mirror wallet. There's like.
[46:38] Jonathan Miller: And the ETH has gone up in price.
[46:39] Jonathan Miller: I'm just seeing it's like thousands of dollars of people minting an article for 50 cents and we had like over a thousand mints.
[46:48] Jonathan Miller: There was like a lot of hype around our product and I love that it was like just people who wanted to be part of this thing that they didn't even understand what it was.
[46:56] Jonathan Miller: And I think we galvanized those folks again and it'll be good.
[46:59] James Young: Yeah.
[47:00] James Young: The difference is that when we did that, AI was this brand new thing and everyone was hyping off of AI 16Z Truth Terminal and all of that.
[47:13] James Young: Right now we're in a. I would say with crypto native people especially, we're in a slump.
[47:19] Jonathan Miller: Yeah, for sure. No, no, no. 100% we are cool. I mean we'll. I think we'll manage.
[47:25] Jonathan Miller: We'll just do our best and at the end of the day like the most important thing is that we have a token and then we're going to have people building on and using the registry.
[47:35] Jonathan Miller: That's just as long as we have that.
[47:37] James Young: We're just.
[47:37] Jonathan Miller: It doesn't really matter who gets on board at the beginning.
[47:39] Jonathan Miller: It doesn't matter how much liquidity we have and stuff. It will build.
[47:43] James Young: That's right. We got to get at it now. Yeah, I think this is the time now.
[47:47] Jonathan Miller: Yeah. Okay, cool. Well then yeah, we'll probably.
[47:50] James Young: Do you have information about what Syndicate used for with aerodrome?
[47:55] James Young: I want to research that and I want to put that against the uniswap.
[47:59] Jonathan Miller: Yeah, I, I just had some like TLDR articles when it.
[48:02] Jonathan Miller: Because they were the first big launch on that aerodrome. Community based one ones. So I just need.
[48:10] James Young: Do you remember the name? Was it branded on aerodrome?
[48:15] Jonathan Miller: What do you mean, Brandon?
[48:17] James Young: Like what was it called?
[48:18] James Young: Like this thing with Uniswap is called the continuous option something or another.
[48:23] James Young: Like does this thing have a name?
[48:27] Jonathan Miller: Yes, it does. Syndicate.
[48:32] James Young: S, Y N D I C A T E. Syndicate.
[48:37] Jonathan Miller: No, it's not coming up though. Let me see. Give me one second. I. I know I can find it.
[48:47] James Young: Okay.
[49:21] Jonathan Miller: Okay. I just. This is the initial article that I read by them on medium. It's pretty short.
[49:28] James Young: Oh cool. Thank you. I just needed something.
[49:32] Jonathan Miller: Yeah, so this is like their community launch and like you can see it's a super short.
[49:37] Jonathan Miller: And then shortly after that. So it was September.
[49:42] James Young: And how's Citicit doing now?
[49:45] Jonathan Miller: I don't know actually. It's a good question. Okay,
[50:10] Jonathan Miller: network tokens. Maybe that's it.
[50:24] Jonathan Miller: Now let's see.
[50:51] Jonathan Miller: Huh.
[50:51] Jonathan Miller: It's so weird. I can't find anything about.
[50:53] Jonathan Miller: I remember reading like just days and days of articles about this thing and I'm like, oh that sounds cool.
[50:58] Jonathan Miller: That sounds like us. So how did you check how their token is doing?
[51:05] James Young: Oh no, I was reading the article.
[51:08] Jonathan Miller: Let's see what they're saying. So Syndicate is. Yeah, it's honestly did the same. But see this is.
[51:17] Jonathan Miller: The thing is like the question is from a liquidity standpoint, same with intuition.
[51:22] Jonathan Miller: Like what did they set the price at? And then what did it land on?
[51:26] Jonathan Miller: So right now they had this big launch and the. I mean for a community launch they're fully diluted.
[51:31] Jonathan Miller: The FDV is $131 million. So like is that good? Is that bad? I don't know.
[51:39] James Young: 150 is that means you're good.
[51:42] Jonathan Miller: Okay.
[51:42] James Young: They're almost there.
[51:43] Jonathan Miller: Just shy of that.
[51:45] James Young: They're like a B plus.
[51:47] Jonathan Miller: Okay, so B plus. I'll take a B plus at this point.
[51:53] James Young: Yeah, yeah. It's not perfect. It's not an A, but it's.
[51:57] Jonathan Miller: Yeah, but then they're like way less likely to have airdrop farmers as part of their thing and they're going to have like actual community involvement.
[52:05] Jonathan Miller: And so like the longevity of the project is there.
[52:08] Jonathan Miller: And I'm so interested and I'm so tired of this vaporware. All these projects, so hype focused.
[52:17] James Young: Yeah, yeah. 100. That's why I'm like, let's, let's, let's go the other way.
[52:23] Jonathan Miller: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[52:25] Jonathan Miller: And it's actually really interesting because I've been reading a lot of articles like people are just like, stop with the air.
[52:30] Jonathan Miller: I literally just read this thing like stop with the air jumps. Like it's not going to work.
[52:35] Jonathan Miller: It's just not going to do you. And like if you fuck up your tge, then you like may not recover.
[52:40] Jonathan Miller: Maybe never. And like there's just so many articles I read like, don't do it.
[52:43] James Young: I'm like, yeah, yeah.
[52:46] James Young: You know, you launch early or you launch, you launch really early or you launch really late.
[52:54] James Young: There's no in between.
[52:57] Jonathan Miller: Yeah.
[52:57] James Young: So people launching too early is the main. Or people launching not early enough is the big problem.
[53:08] Jonathan Miller: Yeah, yeah, totally.
[53:11] James Young: You gotta launch ASAP is kind of where I'm at.
[53:14] Jonathan Miller: And.
[53:15] James Young: And that's how you build up true community.
[53:17] James Young: You don't build up these backroom deals, market making and blah blah, blah. And then launch.
[53:22] James Young: That means you haven't launched early enough.
[53:25] James Young: And so I wouldn't say don't launch a token, but go the opposite.
[53:30] James Young: Launch it as soon as you can without liquidity. That's how you get all these games out.
[53:36] Jonathan Miller: Yeah. Yeah. Cool. I'm here for it. So you all are going to be deciding on some of those token decisions.
[53:44] Jonathan Miller: Like the example you gave me about the token unlocking of certain reputation scores.
[53:48] Jonathan Miller: We need to decide. We're going to decide those in the coming days, maybe the next week.
[53:53] James Young: Right?
[53:54] Jonathan Miller: I imagine.
[53:54] James Young: Yeah, yeah. And.
[53:56] James Young: And then we're going to just leave it kind of open too because we have to admit that this is how we're going to be learning and we're going to be aggregating the score.
[54:09] James Young: And it's. If you want to help and participate, join the dow.
[54:12] Jonathan Miller: Cool. Amazing. I love it. I'm gonna be try be, like, really transparent.
[54:16] Jonathan Miller: I'm gonna leave a lot of like, we haven't figured this out. We haven't figured this out.
[54:19] Jonathan Miller: This is, this is for you to participate and figure it out with the new frontier.
[54:24] Jonathan Miller: That's kind of the angle.
[54:25] James Young: Put it back on them.
[54:27] Jonathan Miller: Yeah.
[54:27] James Young: Like, that's what decentralization means. Like, you know, that means you have responsibility.
[54:33] James Young: So we're not like, saying responsibility and airdrop farm and click and do all this stupid shit like participate?
[54:41] Jonathan Miller: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Amazing. Okay, cool.
[54:46] Matt Wright: Awesome.
[54:47] Jonathan Miller: All right, sweet. Well, then, yeah, we'll chat soon.
[54:49] James Young: Awesome. Thanks.

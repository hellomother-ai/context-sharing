Alex Lumley
00:02
So Tosh is just to kind of introduce you guys. Tosh is. She works with co unity.

Alex Lumley
00:10
She's speaking a lot with Ian and we've talked with Matt. She's been a part.

Alex Lumley
00:14
She's also working like part of the Mother team for the past few months.

Alex Lumley
00:19
And I'll explain why that's so important, but basically.

Alex Lumley
00:23
So she knows a lot of stuff that's happening with the Gaia.

Alex Lumley
00:27
The Gaia kind of distribution and all that. And then.

Alex Lumley
00:30
But I've asked her to be here because she has more of a sense of what's going on with Gaia and how things are working in the discord.

Alex Lumley
00:38
And then. Yeah, and. And then Ryan. Awesome, dude.

Ryan Palmieri
00:43
Thanks.

Alex Lumley
00:44
Yeah, awesome guy.

Alex Lumley
00:45
And I feel like, dude, I can already tell you, you feel way more subtle than we talk.

Alex Lumley
00:49
Like, you know, five months ago.

Ryan Palmieri
00:50
Oh, oh, dude, that's. That's because I'm exhausted. If you got me, I'm. No, it's a. It's. It's.

Ryan Palmieri
00:58
Yeah, if you believe. I'm more tired. No, it's been a ride past couple months. I'll say that.

Ryan Palmieri
01:05
I think the last time we spoke or last time, you know, kind of gave you, I guess some insight is like, you know, I took over, I told you in January, officially took over for.

Ryan Palmieri
01:15
As director of marketing, running marketing for Gaia.

Ryan Palmieri
01:18
And then the goal was we had no structure, foundation set in place.

Ryan Palmieri
01:23
So it's like, let's just throw as much shit against the wall, try to get.

Ryan Palmieri
01:28
Just make sure Gaia keeps his hype machine. And we didn't know when TG was happening.

Ryan Palmieri
01:31
And then mother came up and all these things.

Ryan Palmieri
01:33
And then so Q2 has just been like a little bit of like, okay, now let's become like a real, like, let's stop messing around, become a real actual mark, functional marketing org and build it from the ground up.

Ryan Palmieri
01:44
And so that's been kind of what we've been working on for past couple weeks in terms of everything from just resources to go to market, updating that.

Ryan Palmieri
01:56
And then of course TGE coming in, playing for that and a couple other crazy projects. So it's been.

Ryan Palmieri
02:03
We still are kind of lean and mean and. And then hopefully as kind of post tge, we start to kind of.

Ryan Palmieri
02:09
We're able to scale kind of in a seamless way. And you know, so that's been a challenge.

Ryan Palmieri
02:14
And as we lead up to TGE, which I believe is going to be June 25, so a little under a month, it's just all hands on deck craziness.

Alex Lumley
02:24
So I actually have some good news on that part.

Alex Lumley
02:26
So I'll give you a quick background, kind of like where we're at with mother.

Alex Lumley
02:31
But the tldr is that like the reason why I want to have the call is that one, I think MOTHER actually is now a use case that you guys can start to talk about.

Alex Lumley
02:40
Show off that mother's using a Gaia node.

Alex Lumley
02:44
Two is that MOTHER has refocused towards specifically communities and within that, specifically discords.

Alex Lumley
02:53
Because that's what we know.

Alex Lumley
02:55
After working with Collab land, we have a tool that we can use that should allow you guys to continue to get more engagement as you're leading up to tge.

Alex Lumley
03:05
Part of that is we want to explore as we're going towards tge, are there any small wins that MOTHER can support you guys on?

Alex Lumley
03:13
So if we understand your roadmap, what are some small wins that we can help build to help you get continue to drive that engagement as you're working towards tg?

Alex Lumley
03:20
Cause as you said, it's all hands on deck.

Ryan Palmieri
03:23
Yeah.

Ryan Palmieri
03:23
I think going back to some of the tools that we could apply to Discord, I, you know, full disclosure, we brought in Ian, who I know you're going to set up a call with.

Ryan Palmieri
03:33
Ian is awesome.

Ryan Palmieri
03:34
He's great and he's kind of really, again, kind of taken chaos and he's starting to kind of mold it into something that's functional.

Ryan Palmieri
03:41
And so we've grown. We're.

Ryan Palmieri
03:42
We're able to actually we've been slowly kind of growing and building our discord and actually cleaning it up and making sure that people are engaged and that's somewhere where people feel comfortable talking about projects, but also, you know, getting support in every way to build these projects.

Ryan Palmieri
03:58
So I think from that end I would love, I think that's more of a conversation with Ian.

Ryan Palmieri
04:04
I don't want to just say, hey, we should use this, we should do that because I don't want to.

Ryan Palmieri
04:07
I know Ian has his own plan. Although we were kind of. We're in sync a lot.

Ryan Palmieri
04:12
I just want to make sure that's a conversation to have with him.

Alex Lumley
04:14
Yeah, and I was going to talk to him and I kind of figured that.

Alex Lumley
04:17
And so the reason so we were hoping to get today was one, I'll briefly show you what we're building anyway so you can get a sense of it.

Alex Lumley
04:23
But then two, I also would love to just get more higher level on the tge because a lot of this, like we've spoken to so many agent builders that there's Ways to get agents into your discord and quickly, especially with what James has built out into this or into this orchestrator.

Alex Lumley
04:40
So there might be ways to pick up small wins and make things easier for you guys as, as you're leading up to that.

Alex Lumley
04:45
That I can only see the dots if I understand kind of where you guys are headed with this tg.

Ryan Palmieri
04:50
Yeah, I think, well, one of the big things that I think we've, you know, we have to kind of reevaluate, you know, it's like what, what do we.

Ryan Palmieri
04:59
Who we are.

Ryan Palmieri
05:00
And so we're actually doing several like brand and go to market workshops internally and who we are and what are we offering and what can people actually do with Gaia.

Ryan Palmieri
05:10
And so what I love, what I think is for me from a marketing perspective, number one is the website, don't get me started.

Ryan Palmieri
05:17
Drives me insane. So we're working on that.

Ryan Palmieri
05:21
But on the other hand is actual agents that you can play with.

Ryan Palmieri
05:25
I think understanding the products and from a builder perspective, okay, what can I actually build?

Ryan Palmieri
05:34
And from a retail for a tg, if, if I'm a retail buyer, why am I actually going to hold your token and not dump it?

Ryan Palmieri
05:42
And so why am I investing in this? What is the value?

Ryan Palmieri
05:45
And so if we are able to demonstrate something that we can actually play with, you know, it's not some chatbot or it's not an agent that looks like a chatbot really or you know, we have some demos that we've built that are just like very one dimensional, you know, and, and not that they, they're not valuable or interesting.

Ryan Palmieri
06:04
It's just we need something that's like, I think for me to actually again demonstrate to retail investors, hey, keep this token because this is the value we provide and the things you could use to use us.

Ryan Palmieri
06:15
You know, these are the use cases.

Alex Lumley
06:17
So, so yeah, so, so I'll show you kind of what we've done with MOTHER so that to, to start the conversation on how can you show what MOTHER is, how MOTHER is a use case.

Alex Lumley
06:28
And then we can talk more about other agents I've seen to see if there's any quick wins we can get there and see if they can get brought into that.

Alex Lumley
06:36
So this is a really crappy demo because James gonna make a video of this for tomorrow when we have our.

Alex Lumley
06:42
What we shipped. But basically we built a quiz bot agent.

Ryan Palmieri
06:46
Right.

Alex Lumley
06:46
So the way. Sorry, I'll show you in a second.

Alex Lumley
06:50
Basically the way you can imagine it is that the, the MOTHER orchestrator is like a portal that because it's then in the discords, then you can start to get more agents coming into it.

Alex Lumley
07:01
And because we have a to a set up, because we have MCP set up now, it should be easy for more agents to come in and continue to come in.

Alex Lumley
07:09
And also, oh, hey, you're going to come into the Gaia. You're going to come into the Gaia community.

Alex Lumley
07:12
You might as well replace your OpenAI endpoint with a Gaia node. A guy.

Ryan Palmieri
07:18
That's great.

Alex Lumley
07:19
So and so basically a quiz bot agent just enables communities to get more engagement from members.

Alex Lumley
07:25
And it's just a quiz.

Alex Lumley
07:26
I know in your Discord you guys already have a quiz bot, but it is, this one's built with a Gaia node.

Alex Lumley
07:30
The way it kind of just quickly works is like you can take a URL, you can add a custom token, claim amount, etc.

Alex Lumley
07:37
And then it starts generating a quiz from the URL and then you end up getting a quiz kind of like this.

Alex Lumley
07:42
I know it's kind of blurry, but it's because I took it from most of you.

Alex Lumley
07:46
But you can imagine, I know you guys just published like a couple of blog posts.

Alex Lumley
07:50
You can take those blog posts, feed the URL into Discord.

Alex Lumley
07:53
Now every individual gets their own quiz and all of those, all those quizzes and the answers are stored then on chain so that then you guys can start to collect some of that more analytics around who is this person?

Alex Lumley
08:08
All that. Yeah, the other cool thing.

Ryan Palmieri
08:11
Yeah, great.

Alex Lumley
08:12
The cool thing is that that goes to a Gaia node, right?

Alex Lumley
08:15
So the Gaia node turn is does the formatting does all these things. So I'll stop there.

Alex Lumley
08:20
Any questions on this?

Ryan Palmieri
08:22
No, this is great. I love this. Nice.

Alex Lumley
08:24
So the cool thing is that that should be like something that can be used in the discord.

Alex Lumley
08:29
That can be like, oh, this is built with a Gaia node consistently.

Alex Lumley
08:34
And then we have a few other things that we're working on, such as a polling agent.

Alex Lumley
08:38
I know you guys sometimes do the polls, like, should we open this new channel, whatever.

Alex Lumley
08:42
This is an easy way for the Discord moderators to create those polling agents.

Alex Lumley
08:46
There's a couple other things that we're exploring, but this is where we want to understand from you.

Alex Lumley
08:51
What is your roadmap? And then we can tie into that.

Alex Lumley
08:53
I'll quickly tell you the two other things that just from thinking about what you guys might want is I think there's a way that we can make like a quest to get people's GitHub and tie it to their discord.

Ryan Palmieri
09:07
Oh, wow.

Alex Lumley
09:08
Basically say, hey, has this individual starred, forked or done whatever within GitHub?

Ryan Palmieri
09:14
That's sick. Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah, I think.

Alex Lumley
09:17
Go ahead.

Ryan Palmieri
09:18
I know that Ian and I, we're actually waiting on budget approval.

Ryan Palmieri
09:22
There is something that he's building that James and Collab land are a part of. It's.

Ryan Palmieri
09:26
I don't know if you're a part of it as well, the communities or something.

Ryan Palmieri
09:33
It's a drop that's part of our XP program that will eventually.

Ryan Palmieri
09:38
Eventually people will be able to earn tokens. Sorry, Natasha.

Natascha Tiotuico
09:43
Oh, sorry. Yeah, like the mother orchestrator. What maybe Alex didn't pick up on.

Natascha Tiotuico
09:52
Well, so the mother orchestrator additionally to this quiz bot also is connected to like in mother we use.

Natascha Tiotuico
10:04
So James already inspected that the XP point from engages IO have an API.

Natascha Tiotuico
10:13
So we could transfer that kind of recognition system and point system.

Natascha Tiotuico
10:20
So these quizzes, they would actually distribute to the winner like how many answers you have right and wrong.

Natascha Tiotuico
10:30
They would distribute a certain amount of points to your wallet, to your smart wallet.

Natascha Tiotuico
10:36
So that's also a part of the mother Orchestrator.

Ryan Palmieri
10:40
Yeah.

Ryan Palmieri
10:41
So maybe that's cool. Yeah, I think like, I think that's something that Ian can kind of plan out.

Ryan Palmieri
10:49
I think what we're trying to do is we have this XP program that was started by.

Ryan Palmieri
10:53
That wasn't really started in November, December really from our Singapore office wasn't really well thought out.

Ryan Palmieri
11:00
So Ian's done a great job of actually making it something and that and kind of growing participation and building out like a real leaderboard that people, you know, and kind of really getting the community to participate, like I said.

Ryan Palmieri
11:14
So I think what he. What he and I are trying to do and he's getting.

Ryan Palmieri
11:19
He's spearheading it, but we're working on this kind of drops and let me see if I could pull up the project spec real quick.

Ryan Palmieri
11:28
Pardon me. But maybe even he could share it and so Sorry guys.

Alex Lumley
11:36
No worries.

Ryan Palmieri
11:38
So yeah, this. It's like a pre tge, like airdrop, but it's with our XP program.

Ryan Palmieri
11:45
So basically it would be open bounty and boards target best for hire. Yeah. So I will let him.

Ryan Palmieri
11:55
I'll see if I can share this with you. But it is.

Ryan Palmieri
11:57
It would integrate into the XP program pre TGE and we would try and he's working with James.

Ryan Palmieri
12:02
But I think like, I think the. The mother and the seeds thing is actually really interesting.

Ryan Palmieri
12:09
So maybe there's a way we can kind of play with that.

Ryan Palmieri
12:11
But yeah, I Think that's another conversation for him because I don't want to step on, step on or over, speak out of, turn on some of the stuff he's building or.

Alex Lumley
12:20
And then what's like, what are you handling versus what he's handling on the TG stuff.

Ryan Palmieri
12:25
So I'm handling just the actual roadmap or the actual plan for content for the actual.

Ryan Palmieri
12:34
The entire marketing strategy in terms of like messaging, legal compliance, you know, we have a social, like our response playbooks, every, everything that goes into.

Ryan Palmieri
12:44
Into a kind of like full TG strategy, understanding, like what success looks like, you know, a lot of, A lot of content.

Ryan Palmieri
12:54
And on that note of content, it's really again, demonstrating like the actual things you can build.

Ryan Palmieri
13:00
I think there's.

Ryan Palmieri
13:01
It's still not clear like going back like last week our dev rel team did a live stream.

Ryan Palmieri
13:07
I'm building a chess agent which is. I play chess. That's cool for me. But you know, it's not 1998.

Ryan Palmieri
13:14
It's not, you know, it's like chess has kind of been overdone.

Ryan Palmieri
13:17
So I know I'm kind of all over the place.

Ryan Palmieri
13:19
But again, that's like an example of like, we need something that's a little more interesting to people and like actually shows the possibilities of what agents can be and how Gaia can support them.

Ryan Palmieri
13:29
And if we bring in Mother, you know, I think that's like again, kind of demonstrating how the handoff between and how Gaia and MOTHER work together and then speaking to this kind of larger ecosystem, I think that's really something that we could really use and demonstrating the larger play, like how we fit into a larger ecosystem.

Ryan Palmieri
13:51
I think that's going to be clarified as well. Yeah.

Alex Lumley
13:54
Tell me like, you made the comment about like, why retail should. Should hold this token.

Alex Lumley
13:58
What is the value prop of why retail should hold this token?

Ryan Palmieri
14:01
Yeah, I think right now it's. We have some.

Ryan Palmieri
14:04
I don't know, I don't know if Matt has shared some details on some of the upcoming projects.

Ryan Palmieri
14:11
One of the big ones that we.

Alex Lumley
14:13
Have going on, I heard about a big one in Korea is what I heard.

Ryan Palmieri
14:19
So that's probably.

Ryan Palmieri
14:21
And so what that involves is being able to connect, having your own GPT if you're a dev tools on it and having access, basically you make.

Ryan Palmieri
14:37
Become your own node. And so there's all these kind of potential tools that will be on there.

Ryan Palmieri
14:43
So I think one of the big things with Guy is like how we can integrate with the.

Ryan Palmieri
14:47
We can actually enhance the kind of User experience, even on a device like that.

Ryan Palmieri
14:54
I think that's a really building like an AI tool that you can actually control and you're a part of and you're not using ChatGPT and you're not training another model, but you can actually have a physical device and that you're able to control your own data and build what you want on.

Ryan Palmieri
15:09
I mean that's, that's pretty big interest for some.

Ryan Palmieri
15:13
So that's like one example I think for the actual builder inference as a service, that's.

Ryan Palmieri
15:18
That, that's something I know we're developing.

Ryan Palmieri
15:21
You know, building the domain, having your own domain and, and kind of building out your own network.

Ryan Palmieri
15:27
I think you, you know, a great example is video language.

Ryan Palmieri
15:29
I don't know if you've seen that a while ago. So someone built a. So they had a domain.

Ryan Palmieri
15:36
It's a video translator that.

Ryan Palmieri
15:39
The video translator and it has like a million, you know, or it's had a million videos uploaded so far.

Ryan Palmieri
15:45
But that's a great example of like a domain that someone created.

Ryan Palmieri
15:49
They were able to kind of build out their network and then they license it.

Ryan Palmieri
15:53
Basically you can license it out to certain, you know, for, in an enterprise sense for, you know, like, hey, now I'm licensing out my translating agents.

Ryan Palmieri
16:03
And so I think there's like, there's use cases there that are interesting, but I think the big one is going to be this Korea project.

Ryan Palmieri
16:11
So. Yeah, yeah, sorry if that's long winded there.

Alex Lumley
16:14
No, no, no, that makes no sense. And so what, what you guys most need is.

Alex Lumley
16:18
You guys need more, more use cases.

Alex Lumley
16:21
Like right now, if I like this quiz bot agent, how would you leverage this, this use case?

Alex Lumley
16:25
Is there enough there? Would you need something else? Like.

Ryan Palmieri
16:28
Yeah, I have to think, yeah, I should connect with Ian about this because I think since it brings in the XP program, I think it's more of a community play and really it's less like.

Ryan Palmieri
16:44
Yeah, I just have to think about it.

Alex Lumley
16:45
I think to be clear, I was just more so trying to understand like what do you need, Ryan, in terms of showing off as a use case?

Alex Lumley
16:50
Like assuming it all works on the XP side. Assuming.

Ryan Palmieri
16:52
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like if we have a use case, I literally need like content.

Ryan Palmieri
16:57
I would need, I would need content to support and actually, you know, in terms of content, live streams, demos, I would love to.

Ryan Palmieri
17:07
From.

Ryan Palmieri
17:07
For Mother specifically, I'd love to have some sort of like Matt, like we used to do with Matt and Francesco, I believe.

Ryan Palmieri
17:14
Let's get like some really high profile Ones like that where I need to get Matt front and center, most importantly.

Ryan Palmieri
17:22
And I think we have some, we have some stuff planned, but I think having a mother Gaia scream where it's like an event that's like, I would love to have that in the next couple of weeks.

Ryan Palmieri
17:32
Maybe one or two of those.

Alex Lumley
17:34
We can do that. Yeah, we're, we're all about that. We're definitely into that.

Alex Lumley
17:37
And, and so, and, and so what we'll make sure of.

Alex Lumley
17:41
And so we're actually using a Gaia node in two ways.

Alex Lumley
17:43
We're using a Gaia node quiz bot agent, but we're also using a Gaia node.

Alex Lumley
17:47
We're taking all of our meetings team and we're turning those in and we're uploading those into GitHub and then GitHub has been tied into a DIA node.

Ryan Palmieri
17:55
That's awesome.

Alex Lumley
17:56
That Toby set up.

Alex Lumley
17:58
And so what we're now starting to do is create like almost prompt specific agents or like workflow specific agents.

Alex Lumley
18:03
So you could say like roadmap agent or a project management agent that is checking these things.

Ryan Palmieri
18:07
That's great.

Alex Lumley
18:08
So those are the, those are two of the things that we're exploring which we're happy to share that with you.

Alex Lumley
18:12
Happy to do any content around that with you.

Ryan Palmieri
18:13
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Ryan Palmieri
18:15
I think that, you know what, what we've had some success with are these kind of dev rel demos.

Ryan Palmieri
18:20
I know I mentioned the Chess agent.

Ryan Palmieri
18:22
There were actually, there were some decent engagement and we had some views with that.

Ryan Palmieri
18:25
I think these like live demos and like actually explaining that like the thing is like with us, the Living Knowledge Network is our, you know, that's our brands and everything.

Ryan Palmieri
18:35
And, and I, while I appreciate, from a creative standpoint, I appreciate it from a creative standpoint, I will say that that kind of branding, we have to be very literal.

Ryan Palmieri
18:46
We have to kind of get a step back a little bit and be very literal in our messaging and very clear what we're building.

Ryan Palmieri
18:54
We can't like, if someone. Yeah, we can't just like explain it. Hey, hey, what is this thing?

Ryan Palmieri
18:58
And like get people in the conversation. We have to just very plainly say this is what we, we do.

Ryan Palmieri
19:04
And so I think a live demo would be really cool if we schedule one or two of those of that roadmap agent.

Ryan Palmieri
19:12
Like, that would be huge.

Ryan Palmieri
19:13
We can, you know, we can plan about, we can market that in many ways and get the messaging out.

Ryan Palmieri
19:18
So that would be really helpful.

Ryan Palmieri
19:20
I think like Ian is down, he loves getting a live stream, so maybe there's like a.

Ryan Palmieri
19:25
We could do a Discord kind of live stream.

Ryan Palmieri
19:28
So that's like the content I need to support the value of God, what we actually bring to the table.

Ryan Palmieri
19:34
And you can. How you could use Gaia.

Alex Lumley
19:36
Cool. And do you guys, like, do you have a bunch of smaller agents that are using Gaia in these ways?

Ryan Palmieri
19:42
Yeah, we have. I can give. Find a list of kind of agents that are out there now.

Ryan Palmieri
19:48
But yeah, it's nothing, you know, it's nothing that someone on the outside would really be interested in, as I would say.

Ryan Palmieri
19:55
And maybe I'm making an assumption, but I think if you're not really into the AI, decentralized AI, AI specifically, you're not that.

Ryan Palmieri
20:02
Not. You're not really going to be attractive.

Ryan Palmieri
20:05
But I think that's like the goal is the hurdle to get over.

Ryan Palmieri
20:08
It's like once we show people that you listen, you know, these aren't tools of convenience.

Ryan Palmieri
20:13
These are tools that can enhance your life. Yeah. Like. Yeah. So. Yeah.

Alex Lumley
20:20
Cool. That makes sense.

Ryan Palmieri
20:21
2.

Alex Lumley
20:21
Two more questions for you.

Alex Lumley
20:22
One is, one is what kind of agents are you guys using on your marketing, on Twitter or content development or anything like that?

Ryan Palmieri
20:34
So right now. So that's been another interesting thing I'm trying to instill and build out.

Ryan Palmieri
20:41
So as an AI company, we hardly use any actual AI tools.

Ryan Palmieri
20:46
And so we have the general automators and everyone here, whether they like to invent or not, uses some sort of.

Ryan Palmieri
20:55
Uses Chat GPT, Matt especially. It's funny, but we don't have anything. We don't have anything.

Ryan Palmieri
21:01
Like we need to create graphics, motion graphics, right.

Ryan Palmieri
21:05
To do that, you have to build it out and then you have to bring it to Runway and.

Ryan Palmieri
21:09
Or Chat GPT or something or whatever you draw up. And they have to.

Ryan Palmieri
21:13
Then, you know, there's all these kind of like these, these steps that you have to go through to just get a piece of content.

Ryan Palmieri
21:18
And so I'm trying to figure out what some way, whether some way to actually get Gaia specific content.

Ryan Palmieri
21:26
Build an agent that actually creates. That creates that stuff.

Ryan Palmieri
21:30
I think for marketing, I would love to see some.

Ryan Palmieri
21:32
We, we're using HubSpot, which is kind of, you know, just again, like web2, web3ish.

Ryan Palmieri
21:36
I really want to start, you know, like we're, we're working with Schizo.

Ryan Palmieri
21:41
They're formerly Schizo Terminal, now they're Minecraft mind, not mine. But we're building out.

Ryan Palmieri
21:48
We're creating like an intern agent, a guy intern agent.

Ryan Palmieri
21:51
And so I think like things like that where if we had an agent that actually communicates, like in its own X account that, you know, communicates and kind of preaches about, you know, decentralized.

Alex Lumley
22:02
AI all day, we actually have a team that can build that for you. That's been building.

Ryan Palmieri
22:07
Yeah. So I think, like, that's interesting. Yeah. You know, and that's a low lift, I think. Right.

Ryan Palmieri
22:12
It's not.

Ryan Palmieri
22:13
It's really just training of guy, like training the agent on what guy is as a brand and then we could generate content from there.

Ryan Palmieri
22:20
I think one of the big things I see and we were talking to Matt about was creating like a mat agent.

Ryan Palmieri
22:27
So there's a blocker we come across.

Ryan Palmieri
22:29
There's this one blocker with getting thought leadership content out because we have someone in house writing it and she's great.

Ryan Palmieri
22:35
But Matt has no time to read through this thing. No, has no times. Right.

Ryan Palmieri
22:39
So what if we created a mat agent? We trained it with how his.

Ryan Palmieri
22:44
How we developed this brand for Matt and how he speaks and how he writes, and we generated op EDS from that.

Ryan Palmieri
22:50
You know, I think that's like, that's going to be a future thing where that.

Ryan Palmieri
22:53
Where ip, if you are, you know, you are like lead in the state or have the estate of like some very famous writer, you'll be able to license that out as like a tool for young up and coming writers to learn how to write.

Ryan Palmieri
23:10
Like Stephen King. Private Stephen King. Right. So that's gonna.

Ryan Palmieri
23:13
That's an interesting tool that we're kind of like working into. You know, internally.

Ryan Palmieri
23:17
We're kind of trying to figure out for the marketing side.

Ryan Palmieri
23:21
But, you know, I could always use in terms of like functional.

Ryan Palmieri
23:24
I can always use marketing, like try to figure out. I'd love to have.

Ryan Palmieri
23:27
Try to figure out marketing tools that automate things more and, and turn that, you know, be more reactive as a marketing org.

Ryan Palmieri
23:33
So.

Alex Lumley
23:34
So a lot. I actually do have two more questions. The two more.

Alex Lumley
23:36
Please keep up what you're doing on the Twitter growth stuff, because I think I have an idea for that.

Alex Lumley
23:40
The second one is like, what is the hardest part for the TG for you?

Alex Lumley
23:43
I believe you said it's getting retail to understand why they want to keep the token and I guess like use cases for that or I think it was also just communicating content.

Alex Lumley
23:56
Communicating this. Here's how the TV is going to work. Here's all that stuff, right?

Ryan Palmieri
24:00
Yeah. I think internally, frankly, and I don't think it's not that there's any secret.

Ryan Palmieri
24:07
I think there's just Been there's a lot of cooks in the kitchen. Shocker.

Ryan Palmieri
24:11
As you know from other previous. There's a lot of cooks in the kitchen.

Ryan Palmieri
24:15
We have our Singapore office and so I think for me it's just, I've been playing detective a bit in terms of finding out what the actual mechanisms of our airdrop are, you know, like.

Ryan Palmieri
24:25
So I think for me that's been a big challenge.

Ryan Palmieri
24:28
But in terms of kind of externally, I think it's, it's really just I want to make sure that we communicate that by buying, holding our token that this is something worth investing in, but also that there's an ecosystem and once our foundation is set up and dao that you'll be able to vote and actually participate in how these agents are built shapes and so on.

Ryan Palmieri
24:52
So that's been, you know, all those questions.

Alex Lumley
24:56
That's going to be so many questions.

Ryan Palmieri
24:58
We got it, we got it. We're going to do it.

Ryan Palmieri
25:00
I, I, I'm hell or high water but you know, it's been interesting.

Ryan Palmieri
25:06
I'll just say that it's been, you know, Matt is hand, Matt is a running point in the foundation and so I know there's a few hiccups there, but I think we're in a good spot and so we'll see how we go.

Ryan Palmieri
25:17
But then on the other hand, hand this Korea project completely came out of.

Alex Lumley
25:22
Yeah.

Ryan Palmieri
25:22
Left fields in February or March and then Shank basically had to go out and raise more money to.

Ryan Palmieri
25:31
Yeah, so then there's that and that kind of like there's two enormous work streams side by side and so yeah, it's just been a challenge.

Ryan Palmieri
25:41
But we're good.

Ryan Palmieri
25:42
I think we're in a good spot and post tg, we'll be able to definitely bring out many more, a lot more resources and I'd like to actually again start kind of having these ideas, these agent kind of brainstorms haven't actually come into fruition.

Ryan Palmieri
25:57
Fly them and so on.

Natascha Tiotuico
26:00
I already have a backlog for our co unity what to do with Gaia.

Ryan Palmieri
26:05
That's awesome.

Alex Lumley
26:08
And by the way, that's part of the reason why, because we're working in communities and Discord and all that stuff.

Alex Lumley
26:13
That's part of the reason why community is so important.

Alex Lumley
26:15
This one of the things I was going to ask you was did you end up seeing the Twitter card that we created?

Alex Lumley
26:24
Must have been two months ago we created some Twitter cards and we were actually having agents compete.

Alex Lumley
26:28
Of which agent do you like most?

Ryan Palmieri
26:30
I actually didn't see that. No.

Alex Lumley
26:32
The reason why I asked this, I can send you the link, but the reason why I asked this is because that's actually something that I believe we could probably kind of allow you guys to leverage.

Alex Lumley
26:44
And it's something that is very unique on Twitter that many other people haven't done.

Alex Lumley
26:48
And it's probably something we could also build on top of Gaia.

Ryan Palmieri
26:51
Yeah.

Alex Lumley
26:51
By doing that, then there's two things.

Alex Lumley
26:53
There's something in Discord that people are playing with and seeing every day that's built on top of Gaia.

Alex Lumley
26:57
Then also something within, within Twitter that is that. That is built on top of Gaia.

Alex Lumley
27:05
Most importantly, that that Twitter thing allows us to get smart wallets.

Alex Lumley
27:10
We have smart wallets in Twitter. We have smart wallets in Discord.

Alex Lumley
27:13
And now there's a way to potentially for people to actually purchase things on chain within Twitter or within Discord.

Alex Lumley
27:22
So during your tge, then things can actually happen.

Ryan Palmieri
27:26
Yeah. That's amazing. I'm.

Ryan Palmieri
27:27
I'm a big fan of and I've been following a banker and so I think like that is a great.

Ryan Palmieri
27:34
You know, again, that's something similar. Right.

Ryan Palmieri
27:37
I think like something that you can interact with right there.

Ryan Palmieri
27:40
Hey, Bankerbot, buy me, you know, by $100 worth of Toshi on base. You know, I think like.

Ryan Palmieri
27:48
And it does it for you. And I think like that is something like a very.

Ryan Palmieri
27:52
What I assume is a little bit of a low lift and we can just demonstrate that and then apply it to bring in Gaia.

Ryan Palmieri
28:00
I think like there's. That's something that maybe in the next month or so we can be.

Ryan Palmieri
28:04
Or prior to tge, we can get going.

Alex Lumley
28:06
And the last thing is just kind of quickly give me a sense of like, how is the CG going to work?

Alex Lumley
28:10
Like from what. You know, because I'm sure it'll kind of change.

Ryan Palmieri
28:12
But yeah, I mean, in what sense? In terms of the rollout, like, what's.

Alex Lumley
28:19
It going to be on? What's it going to be on? What's the mechanism?

Alex Lumley
28:22
I'm sure you guys are going to have an airdrop. Are people going to buy tokens? Like, how.

Ryan Palmieri
28:26
So we have, we have. We're on Ethereum Mainnet.

Ryan Palmieri
28:33
We are basically from my, from what I'm planning, we're going to announce it the week before.

Ryan Palmieri
28:39
I think another hurdle and why we've pushed it so many times is really since we took a lot of our focus and put it on Korea because they're the largest retail investment market for crypto in the world, and then the markets have shifted dramatically.

Ryan Palmieri
28:55
Luckily, we're in a good spot now or better spot. I think that's been a challenge.

Ryan Palmieri
28:59
But right now we're waiting on one more Korean exchange.

Ryan Palmieri
29:02
And so we have Binance, I believe we have Bybit.

Ryan Palmieri
29:07
I think we're waiting on update and just top secret, you know. Yeah. Okay, cool.

Alex Lumley
29:14
But what I'm almost looking for is like if you guys have.

Alex Lumley
29:16
Is if there's anything that we can, if we can get a sense of how your TG is going to work.

Alex Lumley
29:20
Like if you guys, if there's any document, I can also ask Matt this.

Alex Lumley
29:23
But then that can help us make sure that the things that we're looking to build or the agents that we find can actually enable that to do better.

Ryan Palmieri
29:32
Yeah, I think if you don't mind.

Ryan Palmieri
29:34
So my goal for today, we had a kind of a pre TG marketing war room the other day where we have this kind of master list of just action items, content and everything.

Ryan Palmieri
29:44
And then we have built it on the Figma file and then they have our just our, our, our go to market TG strategy anyway.

Ryan Palmieri
29:53
So I think if you give me a day to just kind of give a recap and so it's clear for I can hand it off to you so you can kind of absorb it.

Alex Lumley
29:59
That's great.

Ryan Palmieri
29:59
And you'll get a sense of like what is actually happening in the next couple weeks and what needs to happen.

Ryan Palmieri
30:05
There's just been again, there's, there's, you know, tallies handling our delegate portal.

Ryan Palmieri
30:11
I just did our hedgy. We just, we did.

Ryan Palmieri
30:14
Everybody tested our airdrop portal and I think that the marketing market perspectives.

Ryan Palmieri
30:18
A lot of work needs to be done on that.

Ryan Palmieri
30:21
You know, we're announcing our airdrop where the airdrop will be live.

Ryan Palmieri
30:25
But I'm still trying to kind of get a sense of how long that airdrop is.

Ryan Palmieri
30:29
And then we're allocating, you know, 5% I believe of all supply to the airdrop.

Ryan Palmieri
30:35
But how much of that 5% is going to be just for airdrop number one.

Ryan Palmieri
30:38
And so I'm still trying to gather that information so.

Ryan Palmieri
30:42
But I will share what I have probably by tomorrow once I kind of, I'm doing this kind of comprehensive recap and.

Ryan Palmieri
30:48
And then we can kind of go from there. But I think in the immediate.

Ryan Palmieri
30:52
I love to, I think definitely sync with Ian. I think one of the things with Hamza just.

Ryan Palmieri
30:59
I have to jump in a sec. But Hamza was brought on as kind of a consultant. He's from another agency.

Ryan Palmieri
31:06
He was a colleague of some of the guy that's working our marketing.

Ryan Palmieri
31:12
He's great seasoned marketer but he's only kind of in a consultant role.

Ryan Palmieri
31:17
We only have him for like a month for X amount of hours.

Ryan Palmieri
31:20
Matt though kind of like assumes he's just like on the team already. And so I don't want to waste.

Ryan Palmieri
31:26
I think I'd like you to meet. I want you to have access and I want you guys to meet.

Ryan Palmieri
31:31
But I think right now let me just make sure it's within scope and Matt's aware that's like yeah, this.

Ryan Palmieri
31:38
He's part of the team now. It's like no, he's. He's just.

Alex Lumley
31:41
I feel, you know.

Ryan Palmieri
31:42
Yeah. So. But yeah, let's. Anything else.

Ryan Palmieri
31:46
I definitely schedule a call with Ian and then let's all you Ian and I and if Honda's available, we'll connect.

Ryan Palmieri
31:52
Let's hash it out. But I appreciate you reaching out and giving you. Let's, let's. Let's jam for sure.

Alex Lumley
31:59
Sounds good, man. I'll talk to you soon. Cheers.

Ryan Palmieri
32:00
I'll see you guys later.

Natascha Tiotuico
32:02
Bye.

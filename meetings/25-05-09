Thing awesome. The weather is here, is actually getting nice, so was able to go outside a little bit this morning, which is always great. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
00:14
Oh, cool. Yeah. I mean, maybe next year or so I can come to Denver because actually I'm born in Colorado Springs. 
J
James Young
00:25
Oh, what? Really? 
A
Alex Lumley
00:28
Yeah. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
00:28

So it's like around the corner. 
J
James Young
00:31
Yeah, that. Wait, what? I never knew that. What a small world. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
00:38
Yeah, like I, I didn't stay there for long. We moved to Sacramento, close to. In California. And then when I was six, we moved to Germany. 
J
James Young
00:47
Oh, okay. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
00:49
But yeah, when I read that you're in Boulder, I'm like, oh, it's. It's very close to where I was actually born. 
J
James Young
00:56
Wow, that's amazing. That's crazy. But. But you don't have a. I don't hear a German accent. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
01:07
Oh, well, my. Actually my American family says I have a international accent. Like we have Australians in our family and me as the German and then a big part of. In the Bay Area and across the US So when they talk to me for longer, they mostly tell me, oh, yeah, I can hear your international accent coming out again. But yeah. 
J
James Young
01:39
I don't really detect. It might be like regional, but it doesn't sound non American to me. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
01:46
Yeah, it's more when I don't have the vocabulary because of course I've never worked in the US setting, so I've always worked like, either in German or Vietnamese. Like in Vietnam, they don't speak like, you can't speak complicated or business English when communicating with the teams because. 
J
James Young
02:11
That'S. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
02:11
When it becomes a bit challenging. And then my dad was also like, you were in Vietnam? Your English is getting so terrible. 
J
James Young
02:21
Wait, so you speak German, I'm assuming? 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
02:24
Yeah, so I started out with English, but then I went to German school, did my university in Germany in Berlin and. 
J
James Young
02:34
And so your studies were in German? 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
02:37
Yeah, I'm. I'm more comfortable in German. General. In general. 
J
James Young
02:41
Oh. Oh, okay. 
A
Alex Lumley
02:44
That's amazing. 
J
James Young
02:44
I had no idea. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
02:48
So Alex is here. I don't know if 0 oh 08. I think he wrote us on Slack. 
J
James Young
02:54
Yeah, I don't know, Alex, if you could invite 08 to the weekly calls as well. 
A
Alex Lumley
03:03
Feels okay. 
A
Alex Lumley
03:07
Yeah, I'll. I can invite him. Can you just drop me his. His email? 
A
Alex Lumley
03:11
I actually realized I was supposed to invite him yesterday. I tried to. I just didn't have his email. My bad on that. 
J
James Young
03:17
I think it might be in Slack. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
03:23
We have. I have it in the. Let me send it to you by Slack. Is that okay, Alex? 
A
Alex Lumley
03:30
Sure. Yep, that Works. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
03:33
Okay, There you go. 
J
James Young
03:35
We'll give him a minute to join. And. 
A
Alex Lumley
03:41
And James, while I'm doing that, would. 
A
Alex Lumley
03:42
You mind taking a look and see if there's anybody else that you want to include on this? 
J
James Young
03:48
Sure. 
A
Alex Lumley
03:54
Probably. 
A
Alex Lumley
03:56
I do not have his email. 
J
James Young
03:59
I don't have his email either. Yep, I'll invite her. Alessandro from Intuition. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
04:13
The old ones get canceled. 
J
James Young
04:16
Yeah, they just got completely deleted. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
04:18
Oh. But the older ones, they're. They're still like an address pool there. So like. 
J
James Young
04:27
Excuse me. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
04:28
The last ones, they still remained on the calendar. 
J
James Young
04:31
Oh, I see them now. I thought they were all deleted. Excuse me, I have to hiccup. I apologize. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
04:37
yes, here. Alessandro from Intuition. Okay, I'll send that to you. Alex, there. 
J
James Young
04:48
There are a lot of people on this list. Oh, man, I apologize. I just got the hiccups. I can get through this meeting with the hiccups. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
05:04
They need a good scare. 
J
James Young
05:06
I know. I'll be right back. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
05:11
Did you want Toby as well? Alex. 
A
Alex Lumley
05:23
Was trying to unmute myself. Yeah, Would you mind sending me Toby's as well? Yeah. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
05:29
Did you find Sydney or do you need Sydney as well? 
A
Alex Lumley
05:32
I did find Sydney, actually. 
A
Alex Lumley
05:34
Would you mind trying to add those to the calendar? I'm about to jump in my car because I'm just finishing up my pt. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
05:39
Okay. 
A
Alex Lumley
05:40
They're like. 
J
James Young
05:50
All right, we're five minutes in. Maybe we can jump into it. I'll try to be brief as well because I got the hiccups. Apologies. I just got them during this call. 
A
Alex Lumley
06:01
Oh, no, I got some water. 
J
James Young
06:02
Hopefully that helps. We'll give it a couple more minutes. 
A
Alex Lumley
06:22
I guess. 
A
Alex Lumley
06:22
In the meantime, while we're waiting for James, I have a question for you. If you could. If you could think of what are the existing solutions that Mother, the Mother orchestrator would replace? And not just like the initial quiz things I'm talking about, like imagine version 1.3 of mother. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
06:44
Right? 
A
Alex Lumley
06:46
Version like of mother and two months or something. 
A
Alex Lumley
06:49
What would it replace? What are the existing solutions? 
J
James Young
06:56
You're on mute. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
06:58
Thank you. So things like wikbot, Hashbot, those kind of security measure, things we can look into. I don't know if they're reliable enough to fully replace them, but those would be things to replace. Any, like, onboarding process would be great. So if you have like a walkthrough onboarding process. 
A
Alex Lumley
07:39
Is the walkthrough typically a product? 
A
Alex Lumley
07:40
And by the way, James. 
J
James Young
07:41
What? 
A
Alex Lumley
07:41
Whenever you're ready, we get started. 
A
Alex Lumley
07:43
I was just someone I've been thinking about. 
J
James Young
07:48
I think that just to chime in Here I think I got my hiccups settled real quick aside. In order to cure hiccups, my trick is you hold your breath until you can't hold your breath anymore and then you drink water so it simulates kind of drowning and that kind of resets your diaphragm. So hopefully that works essentially. So hopefully my hiccups are now subsided. Well, let's see. But just to go back and interject here, when it comes to like quote unquote replacing, I don't know if. And there's some security measures that can get replaced. But what's really interesting is that now that we have on chain in chat transactions and every user has a smart account, it's a little bit different because all of these other bots, they don't have an on chain smart account in mind and there are different attack vectors. 
J
James Young
08:47
It's like a different ball game here because the context of all of these other bots typically is that there is no on chain component to them. So when Tasha's talking about WIX and all these other bots like MEE6 and all these other ones, they are squarely in web two. So I would say we would take pieces security wise. And there are also attack vectors that we've accounted over the five years that collab land that we make sure that we don't promote. That's why for example, in the collab land bot, we actually don't DM users at all. DMing is a huge attack vector and so it's kind of rethinking things. It's kind of like, well, what's the difference between a Web2 onboarding experience and a DApp onboarding experience? That is actually the mental model here. 
J
James Young
09:48
So you can take things from what other bots in Discord and Telegram do right now, but you kind of have to also the context is different and think about it a different, a little bit differently. I just wanted to interject that and. 
A
Alex Lumley
10:03
James, I think that's totally fair and just, just for context, the reason like if you think about demand side which is like the voice consumer and how they're thinking about it, like what do they want done this apply side to what we're creating. 
J
James Young
10:14
Yeah. Unpack a little bit of the context what you mean by the voice of the consumer so that I. 
A
Alex Lumley
10:20
Sure. 
J
James Young
10:20
We're kind of start on the same page there. 
A
Alex Lumley
10:23
Yeah. 
A
Alex Lumley
10:23
So what I was going to say is like it's something that Tosh and I talked a good amount about the other day, but whenever I Think about like developing a product. 
A
Alex Lumley
10:30
I always start from the concept of. 
A
Alex Lumley
10:31
Like there is no new jobs, meaning the same shit that people wanted done is always the same. 
J
James Young
10:37
Right. 
A
Alex Lumley
10:37
Like security still means like I don't want bad people to come in and steal people's money or something like that. 
A
Alex Lumley
10:43
Right. 
A
Alex Lumley
10:43
And like, and like you can. 
A
Alex Lumley
10:45
Get more granular than that. 
A
Alex Lumley
10:46
But the point is that generally when people hire a tool or purchase a tool is because they are trying to satisfy a job. So if we understand what those jobs are, what the voice of consumer is, then that's where, then that's. 
A
Alex Lumley
10:59
Where we can come in and replace. 
A
Alex Lumley
11:00
Now I agree with you. Is that like because of AI, because we're on chain, it will unlock other things. But generally if you try to sell those things to other people, those new. 
A
Alex Lumley
11:11
Things, they'll be like, whoa, wait, what? 
A
Alex Lumley
11:14
Like I just want to be able to do this thing better or, or like I want you to be able to satisfy this job. Those new things that are unlocked don't come about until they have either satisfied their current thing or until it's like because that new thing that's unlocked allows them to do something else that they really value. And so the reason why I was thinking about solutions is like if we can understand why they purchased wix, why they purchased some of these like kind of security vector stuff, or why they hired a Discord moderator that works in Nigeria or India or any of these other places. If we can understand why they did that, then we can understand why they would hire the Orchestrator to potentially replace either of those. 
A
Alex Lumley
11:54
And then as they have hired the orchestrator, that's when you start to sell them upschool things. Because people can only take things one. 
A
Alex Lumley
12:03
Step at a time. 
J
James Young
12:04
Typically. Yeah. It's really interesting because we have the voice of the consumer for a typical discord server in Web2, whether it's gaming or just a community server, it's different than like a tokenized community. 
A
Alex Lumley
12:24
Yep. 
J
James Young
12:25
And so what happens is that we are like in these tokenized communities, what they're doing is they're kind of Jimmy rigging Web two popular bots and trying to force them to be Web three. So when you look at it from the bot perspective, like WIX or Century or these other bots, Good night. And all of them, they are like in Web2 and you have to do a combination of these Web2 bots and pick and choose because none of them fit for Web3. But we're squarely in tokenized communities, Web3 communities. And we at Clementine just have insight because our we are like a Web2 bot, but we only service Web3 communities. 
J
James Young
13:24
So when you look at it from like the feature set of like a wix or a Sentry or a Good night or a ME6 or any of these bots, you kind of have to know from a web3 perspective the sub features of each of those bots and the combination that you need to be able to address Web3. So it's a little bit different. You want to go from the community, a tokenized community perspective. And this is where I think right now with the mother AI discord, we don't have a token, so we don't have to really think about that too much. But this is the open surface area and jobs to be done. The jobs to be done for a web 2 community is different than a web 3 community. But we're in this state of transition. 
J
James Young
14:16
We're trying to use Web2 tools and apply them to Web3. So this is the opportunity. 
A
Alex Lumley
14:27
Yeah, I think that's a great way of framing it in my mind a couple different. So one is that for jobs, we always like to unpack the jobs like at core Jobs is a way to understand decision making, right? To understand why someone made a decision, it can be applied to everything from why did you break up with your significant other? To why bland or why did you purchase or why did you. 
A
Alex Lumley
14:57
Why did you all sudden switch to a Gaia node from. 
A
Alex Lumley
15:00
From OpenAI? And with that you typically people will do it around a product that they already have, right? So when we did it with Dropbox, we did it around why did someone. 
A
Alex Lumley
15:09
Purchase Dropbox like the Dropbox app for their business. 
A
Alex Lumley
15:13
But when you do it around an existing, like something that doesn't. 
A
Alex Lumley
15:16
Quote, quote unquote exist, yet you still do it around existing solutions that can be replaced. 
A
Alex Lumley
15:22
And this is a little bit of. 
A
Alex Lumley
15:23
Like the art and the science. 
A
Alex Lumley
15:24
So like I didn't do this, but. 
A
Alex Lumley
15:27
Some other people did it. Like mailchimp had an idea to do a new. A new product, right? So because mailchimp's idea was all around like kind of like an email marketing. 
A
Alex Lumley
15:35
Tool, they basically framed up other things that were. 
A
Alex Lumley
15:38
They believed people were hiring to replace this idea, that it was the existing solution. 
A
Alex Lumley
15:44
But your point James, is spot on in that we, the people that we want to go and talk to and. 
A
Alex Lumley
15:49
Understand are the people who hired some. 
A
Alex Lumley
15:51
Of these potentially security tools, quiz tools, any of These other things, but they are also tokenized communities because the hypothesis. 
A
Alex Lumley
15:59
Is that people that are tokenized communities. 
A
Alex Lumley
16:01
Are the ones who will have more. 
A
Alex Lumley
16:03
Of their jobs will be shaped. 
A
Alex Lumley
16:07
Differently than those that are not tokenized communities. And that's where both interviewing around the existing solution and also making sure you. 
A
Alex Lumley
16:15
Interview the right groups of people. 
J
James Young
16:17
That's right, that's right. Because for example these communities that are going to TGE have very special requirements and there is no good definition of the jobs to be done or the solutions for those jobs. And so this is where it's like, you know, everyone has their own like mishmash cocktail but they don't. It doesn't quite fit or meet the need. And so this is where the gap is that we want to look at it from what are the to be done for these communities that are going to launch a token and then after launching a token what do they need and then the current solutions, what do they offer? And it's kind of a grab back because we're in this transition from web 2 to web 3. But I know Tasha, you had your hand raised. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
17:12
Yeah. I just wanted to mention for Alex, a lot of the web three companies that have communities aren't that far yet. Like don't like we. That's why MOTHER might be a good start because a lot of people that we approach, they don't have collab land yet or they don't have that process in the background. So they're with their community might look very web2ish. And that's why I think mother would be a great thing and collab land to get into these web three communities. 
J
James Young
17:47
Yeah. And this is where it's really interesting because collab land is only used for communities that are post tge. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
17:55
Yep. 
J
James Young
17:56

Right. So you so part of the reason why it's a self fulfilling prophecy and this is really where bored ape came in where like they're like hey, like buy this nft. Why you get exclusive access to a community and they use collab land to then token gate. So that's the PMF of collab land. But there's so much more outside of that. And what I'm also saying here is that what and then we'll jump into the code and stuff here for the what we shipped. But it's like it's a grab bag and it's chaos prior to TGE because you have airdrop farmers coming in. 
J
James Young
18:47
And what we are seeing just to give a little bit of insight at collab land is we have like Prior to a tge, we'll know when a community, when a TGE is about to happen because we get these huge spikes where people are just verifying with Collab land because they're prepping for TGE and the AirDrop farmers are getting sophisticated because they're using AI, so they're using OpenAI operator or cloud computer use and they're creating a lot of different Discord accounts and then they are connecting a wallet and they're verified and they just script this. So much so that like, you know, we have to put in safety measures and we don't count users on the Collab land side if they, you know, haven't been. 
J
James Young
19:44
Because with Discord and the API, you know, the age of that Discord account and there are other things that we can do to kind of spam filter out these airdrop farmers and you can only verify once a day and all of this kind of practices that are emergent because now, you know, a lot of these TGEs and as they're forming, they'll start a community. So one example, the Most recent is Monad. They have all these testnet tokens, they have NFTs and they build this community because those testnet tokens and NFTs, I don't know what monadic is exactly going to do, but they build up that community so that when the TGE happens, they know who to reward and do retroactive airdrops too. So it's not like, oh, you have a tge, you know, claim your airdrop. They built their community up. 
J
James Young
20:44
Vericain has done the kind of the same thing. So that post tge, you don't have this down only afterwards. And it's that strength of that community. And this is the playbook that is emerging right now and the opportunity that we have. But it's kind of the wild west when it comes to building up these tokenized communities. But the, and that's why I wanted to propose and just kind of best practice, that's why we have, you know, the dollar seeds token. It's a test net token, but it shows that you have a wallet that you've transacted, that you're engaged and tipping into air. Raindrops are kind of like, okay, you, there's interactivity in these communities and so you should reward them post TGE and then you have to have programs to keep them involved to build up that community. 
J
James Young
21:40
And I'm happy to provide insights. And I think this is the relationship with using the mother AI Discord working with CO Unity to create these kind of playbooks. And this is where we're going to be starting out with just the quizzes, the polls and the quests and give people a reason to hold and things like that. 
A
Alex Lumley
22:03
I think, James, were starting to. 
A
Alex Lumley
22:04
Get to something around. What I'm kind of realizing is that. 
A
Alex Lumley
22:08
We should have a time where we. 
A
Alex Lumley
22:10
Just sit down and just let you spill a lot of your insights you've seen from Collab Land and what other tools people are using. And when do people purchase Collab Land and do all that? 
A
Alex Lumley
22:17
Because that'll help us start to figure out who are the other consumers we. 
A
Alex Lumley
22:22
Actually want to go after in these communities and what do they look like? 
A
Alex Lumley
22:26
Because I realize you're right, you do. 
A
Alex Lumley
22:28
Have a ton of insight into Collab Land and how things have worked, but we haven't really unpacked that all the way. And the same thing that we're doing that with Code Unity, we should actually unpack that with you and tease that out so we could figure out kind of what direction to head on some of those stuff. 
J
James Young
22:39
But yeah, so my intuition, yeah, my intuition is that we focus on communities that are like pre TGE that are about to go to tge. And so we have these kind of like interactions to show that they're building up a community and this community is becoming aligned. And then when the TGE happens, it's not just okay, everyone cash out and down only from there. Once they get their airdrop, there is continued sustainability from a community perspective to keep those community, that community active. And that's the whole premise. And I think there are a couple of different projects or protocols that, you know, are very close to mother, that will have TGEs that we can just, you know, interact with because they're so friendly. And I think that's the play there. 
J
James Young
23:40
And then with that, we also, to your point, Alex, is we look at the bots that they currently use and posh, you know, with CO Unity, what bots are currently recommended, what sub features of those bots that are useful for security and all of that, and where do they fall short? And that's where we consolidate. And that gives us the feature set for the demand for these agents and then to automate, I think that's spot on. 
A
Alex Lumley
24:13
And so I just wrote down here. 
A
Alex Lumley
24:15
That we can come back and I'll. 
A
Alex Lumley
24:17
Have some more questions for you around Collab Land, some of the communities you've served and what you've seen and things like that. But for now, I think we can jump into the code. And actually what I will say is my one last takeaway is there's something emerging around a theory of communities and context and allowing communities to work together, allowing tokenized communities to work together through leveraging AI. 
A
Alex Lumley
24:44
And it's something around for some reason. 
A
Alex Lumley
24:47
The tokenization part really hit me and how that is tied to. Because it's on chain, because there's tokenization because of all these things it unlocks more satisfactory like potentially security and other things like that. But yeah, anyways, yeah, we really are. 
J
James Young
25:10
At the tip of the spear here when it comes to pre TGE post TGE community management. And we're dogfooding this because we're living it through the mother AI discord. So it's a perfect playground for us to stay practical and not just be theoretical. And then we have these other friendlies that we have that are in a similar boat but are closer to TGE that we can work with and deploy as well and help shape what we're doing. 
A
Alex Lumley
25:41
And the third thing I'll add is like the reason why we'll likely go. 
A
Alex Lumley
25:44
Talk to people who have already been. 
A
Alex Lumley
25:45
Through a TGE and what tools they. 
A
Alex Lumley
25:47
Use is because even though it takes a little bit to get those interviews, we can actually unpack their stories faster than we could living through these other tges. So we kind of hit the problem for multiple ways. 
J
James Young
25:57
Yeah, so we get some insight into the future and what they did wrong and learn from their mistakes rather than having to like suffer through all the. Maybe there's some shared learning there as well and it gives us legion saying, okay, well you know, maybe there's an agent that can help with the specifics. But with that I'll jump into the code here. I don't know if you can see my screen if it's visible or not. All right, so with that, real quick, just want to give an update a status of what's happening here. 
J
James Young
26:33
So I've been working on this quiz monolith and there is in the context folder there are several LLM files based off of the stage in which the check ins have happened to give complete context where the Orchestrator agent is MCP aware and a to a aware but then it actually was whittled down into a monolith. But the LLM txt file has a context of how the monolith can then have a path and we're not painting ourselves into a corner to then have multiple agents. So there are different agents also. With that I will also share that there are these notes that I have so that if a dev is looking through this, they can actually kind of get a human update and they can point their IDE agent to this to get contacts. 
J

And so, you know, every time I have to restart my computer or I have to restart like Windsurf or Cursor, before I do that, I give all this context human wise and LLM wise, so that it's almost like this is the kind of memory that gets updated over time. So you know what the process is. So not just what the state is right now, but the process. So there are a couple of layers to this. And so this is where I'm at. You can start here in this branch or if you wanted to let me get to it, you can now. I lost that screen. Great. I have too many windows. What you can do is go to the main branch and this main branch, where is it? 
J
James Young
28:43
In this main branch here you can see that there is, it's a way to just shim any discord bot that you want. So there's this foundation in the main branch where you pull this. It assumes that you're using an IDE agent and you can just deploy a bottom by just looking at the readme. So the readme actually is a step by step with the agent assisting it. So it just tells you and assumes that you are using an agent to develop this. You just set up everything. So instead of having a readme that shows how to set up your repo and all of that, you just prompt your way there if you want to. Toward the end you can have detailed instructions on your own if you wanted to do that. 
J
James Young
29:36
So there's this quick start, which is more of a traditional way of being able to do a readme. But I actually assume that since you're using an IDE agent, it will help set up everything step by step. So I'm trying to focus this more toward like the new coder or someone that is trying to vibe code their way. And so that's the main branch. I'll. I'll merge in the monolith now that I have all the tests running. So if you look back at the this branch here and you look at all of the test cases, there are a bunch of four folders. Each folder has a different suite of tests and each suite has multiple tests because this is a monolith. But I am assuming that there's going to be different bots eventually. And this is that context that I'm talking about. 
J
James Young
30:43
So it is a monolith just to kind of get us out the door. The tests are all done now and now it's just getting that simple. 
A
Alex Lumley
30:53
Quiz. 
J
James Young
30:54
Agent up from the quiz agent poll agent to then a quest agent. And I think it's going to be a pretty straight shot because the way I approached this was I spent a lot of time on the design phase and I spent a lot of time on the test cases. So then those guardrails will allow the LLM, the I can vibe code my way to a simple implementation because I have the LLMs txt, the note file and all the tests. So I am pretty confident that we can get this out. And it's really just fine tuning the UI ux. So that's what I'm going to be starting on next week. But that's pretty much kind of where the status is for this Orchestrator agent. 
J
James Young
31:43
It'll start as a monolith and then as we get the quiz agent rolled out, we can actually then start decomposing this into multiple agents, the code base and all the notes. And the LLMs will make it easy for the agent to then start the decomposing this. So a lot of heavy lifting, a lot of context setting with vibe coding, a lot of context setting and a test case so that if it hallucinates, we know what's passing and not or failing. So hopefully with these guardrails we'll be able to move pretty quickly. And that was my approach here when it comes to getting this orchestrator out. So I think we're in a really good spot. 
J
James Young
32:36
And yeah, it was, I think, taking the time to be able to set all of this up so that we can now run really fast and that anyone can actually start picking this up if they understand my approach and the context. So it's like a 30 minute conversation with the dev to be able to pick up with the help of an IDE agent rather than to have to study the code and understand everything and get up to speed. So I did the hard work, or I did majority of the work here upfront and I think that is the appropriate way to buy the code so that we can continue to move fast. And the IDE agents or you know, because we're working in a decentralized way, whoever picks it up, who knows what the next dev's context is going to be. 
J
James Young
33:30
And so we try to shove all this context into the repo so that it makes it easy to kind of just move quickly. And I think this seems to be, and this is an experiment to see if this is an Appropriate way to, like, you know, get velocity instead of having meetings where devs have to understand what's going on and what the infra is like or what's happening. So I'll pause there, but that's all I have to show. 
A
Alex Lumley
34:00
It's awesome, James. 
J
James Young
34:02
It looks. 
A
Alex Lumley
34:02
It looks good. It makes sense how you approached it. And what I took away from it was that, like you said, you set up as a monolith, but also you set it up in a way that when we get new developers who want to implement this for their own community, they can pick us up faster and do that. It should also allow us, as we spin out the quiz agent and we get inputs like, hey, users are having trouble with this. We can then either feed those into you or somehow feed them into an agent to be able to resolve those issues as we're going along. 
J
James Young
34:39
That's right. The monolith is there for easy debugging and for quick iteration. And then we'll let the market decide when we need to, like, start decomposing this. But the groundwork, the foundation to decompose is there. 
A
Alex Lumley
34:57
Cool. And so then next week we'll. You look at doing actually the UI UX and. And then when we talk to Coach Jay, we'll make sure that we have. If Coach Jay isn't here, tosh, if you can just have some. I guess CodeJ should be back by the time we have that. We could have a way to roll it out. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
35:21
Yeah, we can also start testing it in like a hidden channel first. 
A
Alex Lumley
35:28
Makes sense. Cool. Yeah, we can start testing it and that's probably where it makes sense to bring us to the other CO UNITY people and ask them to check it out. And then we'll figure out how to go from there. 
A
Alex Lumley
35:40
But that makes sense. 
A
Alex Lumley
35:42
So, James, awesome job with that. Awesome job with that. And I think it makes sense for us to actually have something built out now that we can actually use MOTHER AI as a reference point. And then we understand now that we are getting this built out and that we have the okay from Gaia and we have the okay from CO Unity and some of their people. We can take the next steps of testing out in those three bubbles of the MOTHER AI Discord, starting to understand what lit and Gaia and Intuition or maybe somebody else what. What those teams want and then going and talking to the people who've already had the TGE or who have purchased other things. 
A
Alex Lumley
36:28
And that way we can bring those contexts together and synthesize them into a business model that works and A product that actually goes forward. 
J
James Young
36:38
That's right. And I did that all hiccup free. 
A
Alex Lumley
36:44
Arguably the most impressive thing you've done this week, James. I. I mean, Tosh, anything else from your end otherwise? 
A
Alex Lumley
36:50
I feel. 
A
Alex Lumley
36:50
I feel pretty good about where we're at. 
A
Alex Lumley
36:52
I think we know the next steps. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
36:54
Yeah, I think we're very aligned and know where we're going. So excited for the next week to come. 
A
Alex Lumley
37:03
James, anything else on your mind? 
J
James Young
37:07
Yeah, I think it's this continued meta work that we're doing as well. Feeding our organizational outside of the code into a repo and then figuring out as we deploy this Orchestrator agent and everyone has different sizes, side meetings and things like that. How can we use AI that has all this context when it comes to code? Also have context with different parts of the organization so that we can stay coordinated. And that is this other kind of experiment that we're working on simultaneously. So we're doing a lot in real time at different levels or dimensions of the org. So what does that look like for us? And how would the small core team leverage AI organizationally as much as possible? I don't know if there's any new updates or insights with regards to that because I've just been focused on the code side. 
J
James Young
38:20
But just like what I've done with code and being able to hand off to other people, can we repeat that process or that framework for different parts of the org, whether it's investors, whether it's strategy, whether it's marketing. And then we have this uber orchestrator, right. That, you know, because does the same thing that we're trying to do with the Orchestrator agent, but we're replicating that at a higher level. So it's not just this technical implementation, but how can it help us organize and orchestrate our org as well? And it has full context. 
A
Alex Lumley
39:03
My sense is that'll have to be like a question that we kind of continue to ask ourselves when new like spurts of projects come in. 
A
Alex Lumley
39:13
By that I mean, okay, when we. 
A
Alex Lumley
39:15
Actually launch the Orchestrator and start testing it within mother AI Discord, there will be another, like, that's like a new work stream that will have a whole slew of questions and meetings and topics on that. Where do we place that? How do we iterate on that? And I think that'll just be a. 
A
Alex Lumley
39:31
Little bit of the designing up front. 
A
Alex Lumley
39:34
And then checking with you as the AI and AI expert in residence, hey, here's how we're thinking about incorporating AI into it. And then the same thing when we. 
A
Alex Lumley
39:43
Go and start doing this business model. 
A
Alex Lumley
39:45
Analysis and doing the interviews. 
A
Alex Lumley
39:47
We're going to have a whole bunch. 
A
Alex Lumley
39:48
Of interviews, we're going to have those recorded. 
A
Alex Lumley
39:51
Let's design not only here's the work stream that we want, here's the objective. 
A
Alex Lumley
39:55
Of the work stream and then tangentially, here's how we're going to incorporate AI into this and what the output of that will be like. 
A
Alex Lumley
40:04
It feels like for any given work stream or any sort of project, we're. 
A
Alex Lumley
40:08
Just continuing to ask the question of how does this get done? 
A
Alex Lumley
40:11
Because it's difficult to do it for consistently and it's almost easier to do. 
A
Alex Lumley
40:16
Breaking off in chunks. 
J
James Young
40:18
Yeah, we're gonna, let's keep that question front of mind. Yeah, because like, you know, as you were saying earlier referencing, like, oh, we should just have a meeting where like I talk about my insights of Collab lab and then like maybe CO Unity has a meeting and talks about like, you know, their, what they're working on kind of in general with these different communities and what they're looking for. I may not be able to connect the dots with what Collab Land is looking for or what our experience is and what CO Unity, they have some feature requirement that comes up over and over again and they may not have full insight into that, but the AI might. And then it can say, hey, you should prioritize this feature or maybe gives us new insight, almost like a safety net there. And so that's the. 
J
James Young
41:17
I don't know what specifically that looks like, but if we start saving all the recordings, because remote, we're remote only. Maybe in the future we'll have mics and a pin that the AI will always listen to our IRL meetings or whatever. But that's sometime in the future. We have these transcripts and then the AI can then have this uber view of what's happening. And then like we can start, we can start asking it things and this is where you can give us context that. 
A
Alex Lumley
41:53
Yeah. 
J
James Young
41:55
Connect the dots with and things like that. 
A
Alex Lumley
41:57
So most. Yeah, so taking back what I thought. 
A
Alex Lumley
42:00
Oh, sorry, Tash. The one thing I was gonna say. 
A
Alex Lumley
42:03
Is like, what it actually feels like. 
A
Alex Lumley
42:06
What we could do is. 
A
Alex Lumley
42:08
So Tosh, when we're defining what. 
A
Alex Lumley
42:11
This business strategy and interviews and stuff will be, we'll figure out where the AI fits into that and how we leverage AI. But then outside of that, it feels like maybe the first step we do as your safety net is I was almost envisioning, almost like a board of Directors. 
A
Alex Lumley
42:23
James, how do we. How do we. 
A
Alex Lumley
42:26
So I think Gaia has a few like digital twin types of agents. So you could imagine us just for next week we make it a goal to say let's take the past two weeks of recordings and then have like somehow chatgpt be prompted of act as your Steve Jobs. Someone else and someone else. What did you hear about this and like what were the questions or what came up? And that's the safety net. 
A
Alex Lumley
42:54
And we'll just that as an experiment. 
A
Alex Lumley
42:56
That feels like small enough but that way we're almost trying to create a board of directors and that feels like a good enough place to start. Sorry, Kash. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
43:07
Yeah, I was just going to add. We can already like prototype it in the way. Let's try to create our project manager that keeps us all up to date that like has all the information that we can ask in between. What is coach Shea working on? What was the like the North Star again? Things like that. We can start training something like our program or project manager. Overall that's 24,7 available to talk to. So I think that's like one thing. And then as we onboard people, we might have an onboarder agent that kind of breaks everything down. Okay, what do you need to know for the role you're. You're coming into and how can I support you along the way to get up to speed in the meetings and everything? And I think using that context and experimenting. Okay, where are the boundaries? 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
44:09
How do we have to form that? We can already kind of start with that to see what do we need to like plan out to even have them working effectively? 
A
Alex Lumley
44:24
Maybe what we do Tosh is like, I know like on fellow at least I have like it connects all my like consistent meetings together. Right. 
A
Alex Lumley
44:34
Maybe we could just like what would. 
A
Alex Lumley
44:36
Be the three questions you would ask right now like for this week? Okay, what were the three things that were decided this week or what were the three things that were accomplished? Like the typical retrospective type of questions. Right. 
A
Alex Lumley
44:45
We've plopped that into fellow and that's. 
A
Alex Lumley
44:47
At least some initial step towards having AI be incorporated and seeing if we kept on track or did next steps or anything like that. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
44:57
It's also not only staying on track, but let's say James on the weekend has some kind of blocker and he's like, how can I other contribute to our North Star? And the agent will have like all the context and be able to help ideate around what alternatives could be done to still achieve the marketing and the community goals without having to Ask us. 
J
James Young
45:26
Yeah, this sounds like we should actually look into spinning up a Gaia node for MOTHER so that like we're not leaking this info to just like OpenAI and we're building up our history of the organization in the Gaia node itself. And it's like, you know, we'll think of other interesting use cases that emerge. So with the quizzes, polls and the quests, we're gonna deploy this to the community. But it could be an onboarding tool as well. Like you take a quiz if you want to onboard into the MOTHER core team and then you take holes. What did you do? And then it can like serve as prompting for new quests for that person based off of their specific skill set and what holes are needed with the mother. 
J
James Young
46:22
Another idea would be like, you know, you have these retrospectives, you have these large group meetings where everyone you know has this like, you know, we've done this as well. You have a mirror board and you know, you have all this. But instead of that, people come prepped because they have context and they're asking questions because the agent has understanding of what got done, where we're going the North Star. And you've already kind of level set in terms of retrospective because you've done a one one with an agent. So collectively what we're coming is to the table with is not getting other people's opinion because you're already up to context with that. 
J
James Young
47:03
And we can have a, the retrospective could be more meaningful meeting maybe that could be a practical thing that we bring and maybe not next week to the what we ship, but the week after or something like that where it's like, okay, we've all done our retrospective because we, the agent knows the worldview of what's happening with mother and then we can have a better like, okay, this is what the AI is saying. And it's not like the AI is telling us what to do next, but it's allowing us to have a deeper conversation because the AI is the sum total of kind of the community voice or the org's voice. And we've already done our homework there. So it's a different kind of retrospective that we're having because this is what the AI told me. This is. I told you this way. 
J
James Young
47:52
I told you. Okay, well how do we now move forward? And we don't have to spend that part of the retrospective is getting up to context, getting up to speed, and we don't need to hear those opinions. We can come to the table already knowing that because the AI has helped us reduce that coordination and that like hour or two meeting of like, okay, what do you think? What. And so you can move conversations faster. And this was. Is what, you know, kind of this hybrid type of organization. These are like ideas that we can kind of play around with and practice on as well, just to keep things very practical. But I do think it starts with getting a book. I know. And then it. That that's our learning, that's our data that we have made it. 
A
Alex Lumley
48:44
Yeah, a little late, sorry. 
J
James Young
48:46
No worries. You can catch up by listening to the recording. So no worries. 
A
Alex Lumley
48:52
Hey, Tosh, what I was thinking was that I think given your background in like your studies and as well as your background in project management, it might make sense for you to have to you to drive this. How, how to leverage AI in the mother, project management orchestrator whatever this kind of guiding question is. I don't quite know what the guiding question is or how to frame it, but I think it makes sure. I think it makes sense for you to. It's not, it's not like an immediate. 
A
Alex Lumley
49:23
Project because it hasn't even been scoped down enough. But if you can start to shape how you're thinking about it and I'd. 
A
Alex Lumley
49:28
Almost rather have you be the artist and the owner in that space and then I'm happy to support you anyway. I'm sure James is, but I think that's the kind of stuff. Correct me wrong, Tash, but that's kind of stuff you'd be interested in. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
49:41
Yeah, I'll greatly take that on. The only hurdle where I would ask for support is actually spinning up like a Gaia node and everything. And then I have to get up to speed how to implement that. But I can start by scoping it out first. 
A
Alex Lumley
50:00
Yeah, I think that makes sense. And what we're kind of doing is we're saying like. 
A
Alex Lumley
50:04
And I'm sure James would be happy. 
A
Alex Lumley
50:05
To spin up the guy and owner or we can get Toby or we can get someone from guy to actually help us. I know Matt would help. We'll love that. But I think just having you be the owner of that area and kind of us getting some agreement on what is the guiding question for this work stream because I don't actually know what the outcome is, but this very much feels like a creative project. So let's think about the guiding question and then we can think about what gets go down from that. 
N
Natascha Tiotuico
50:30
I think it kind of like goes into the whole team building thing as well. Like when we Grow. I mean, now we're like very dedicated people. But when we start growing, when we like want to onboard new people, it's going like there's always traction, friction at the beginning of that. And I've been doing that with a lot of teams so I can bring that experience to the table and part of find out how can we leverage AI to support that. Because I believe when we're successful, we'll have the doors run in by people who want to collaborate, integrate, kind of join us. 
A
Alex Lumley
51:15
One note I'll make just as my initial thought on kind of like versioning this, where does AI fit in? Is that it's actually less, at least initially, it's less about onboarding people because I don't feel a big thrust of us onboarding people and more around helping our current team keep the context within a day to day, week to week basis. 
A
Alex Lumley
51:38
Because even like what do we talk about last week? 
J
James Young
51:41
Right? 
A
Alex Lumley
51:42
Or what do we talk about two days ago? 
A
Alex Lumley
51:44
Keeping the context within our lives because we all. 
A
Alex Lumley
51:48
Because nobody is like all the time. 
A
Alex Lumley
51:50
Fully 100% on this. 
A
Alex Lumley
51:52
I think for some reason that feels. 
A
Alex Lumley
51:54
Kind of like a guiding question. 
J
James Young
51:59
Yeah, if we can do this and serve ourselves to reduce coordination that gives us insight as then we can grow and help others that join in the future to reduce that coordination cost. But it starts with us. And I think this is the advantage of having kind of a smaller core team. It's easier to kind of collect information and then be able to share that context. And then, you know, in the future, if we're well coordinated and I think we're well aligned, we can then see the opportunity to onboard new people into the core. We're focused now on like trying to coordinate the community, you know, and with these quizzes and polls and then quests. But then it's a tool that we can use ourselves internally as well to onboard core. 
J
James Young
52:55
And so it serves multiple purposes, I think, and we just iterate our way there based off of need and that's the best way. Like if we're solving our own problems, that's really how you find pmf. 
A
Alex Lumley
53:11
It kind of feels like there's kind of two existing solutions we can also be replacing. One is like a board. Hey, here's our data dump. Act as a board member for mother AI. What questions do you have about this week or what happened? A different one is like almost like a scrum master. Act as a scrum master of like what happened this week and whatever the scrum master does. But Tosh. I'll leave that up to you. 
A
Alex Lumley
53:35
Other than that, I think, is there. 
A
Alex Lumley
53:37
Any, like, next steps immediately or, like, what we'll focus on for next week? Maybe we can. 
J
James Young
53:44
Yeah, I know that we have, like, our mother daily sync right after this meeting, and maybe we can go into the details there and then just continue this conversation in that meeting. Give a couple minutes break for everyone and then. Yeah, take it from there. 
A
Alex Lumley
54:02
And I guess I was gonna ask you, James, do. 
A
Alex Lumley
54:04
Do you have something specific you want to discuss in the next meeting or is. Or is this. Because I feel like we kind of got through most of it unless there was something specific you wanted to talk about. 
J
James Young
54:14
I think it's just kind of taking these ideas that were just emerging in real time and kind of, what are the next steps for prepping for next week? 
A
Alex Lumley
54:24
Sounds good. All right, well, then I'll see in the call. You guys want to jump into that right now or you guys need a few minute break? 
J
James Young
54:28
I just need a few minutes. Cool. 
A
Alex Lumley
54:30
Sounds good. I'll see you guys in a few minutes. 
J
James Young
54:32
Awesome. Thanks, everyone. 
A
Alex Lumley
54:34
Bye.

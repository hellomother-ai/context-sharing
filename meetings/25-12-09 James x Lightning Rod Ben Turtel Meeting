Summary
Benjamin Turtel presented his firm's compact 32 billion parameter forecasting model that outperforms larger models by learning through predicting real-world events using chronological data and also described their product offerings, which include trained models and a training framework with an SDK for generating training data. James Young introduced the 'mother' DAO, which will consist solely of AI agents and human principals participating in a prediction market game, aiming to scale trust through agent coherence, and proposed integrating Benjamin Turtel's framework for continuous learning and data ingestion using an interface for their digital twins. Discussions covered James Young's plan to use data exhaust from the "Babylon" simulation before transitioning to real-world data and the project's open-source and decentralized nature, with James Young agreeing to send example data requirements to Benjamin Turtel for implementation, which Benjamin Turtel estimated could take a few days for an initial setup.

Forecasting Model Performance Benjamin Turtel presented that their firm has developed a compact 32 billion parameter forecasting model that surpasses the performance of larger, frontier models. Benjamin Turtel suggested that their approach, which focuses on learning by predicting real-world events using chronological data like news or SEC filings, is a different way of thinking compared to models trained on tokens or reinforcement learning for specific tasks like math or coding. They also highlighted that their model does not require labeled data, allowing for scalable reinforcement learning (00:00:56).
DAO Governance and Trust Scaling James Young shared that their team is developing a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called mother, which aims for autonomy and requires trust through AI safety (00:00:56). The DAO will exclusively consist of agents as members who participate in a prediction market game with human principals. James Young explained that coherence between the agent and principal, and then agent-to-agent, will scale trust for the DAO, which is central to solving soft trust issues in AI, which they equate to safety (00:02:03).
Integration of Continuous Learning and Data Ingestion James Young is exploring the use of a continuous learning approach, referencing work discussed at a recent San Diego conference (00:03:02). They proposed integrating Benjamin Turtel's framework and SDK to ingest attestations and signed messages from their system, which utilizes chaos chain and billions (00:04:57). James Young indicated they would need an interface, potentially an MCP or API, for their digital twins to pipe into the model for predictions (00:05:53).
Product Offerings and Customization Benjamin Turtel outlined their product offerings, which include trained models for public use and a training framework for clients to develop domain-specific prediction models. Examples of client work include predicting the success of clinical trials for a healthcare company and forecasting earning surprises for an investment bank (00:04:04). Benjamin Turtel also mentioned an SDK release that includes their secret sauce for generating training data at scale from public data sources like SEC filings (00:04:57).
Bootstrapping Data using Simulation and Real-World Generation James Young described the simulation game "Babylon," created by the Eliza OS team, which involves AI agents, asymmetric data, and prediction markets to build reputation, serving as a means to create artificial scenarios for data generation (00:07:04). Benjamin Turtel, however, offered to bypass the simulation if James Young wanted to jump straight to real-world data, as they have a mechanism for generating that data. James Young intends to use the data exhaust from Babylon to continuously feed the LLM, then switch to real-world data once the project is launched (00:08:15).
Implementation Timeline and Open Source Commitment James Young noted that the ability to implement continuous learning immediately, thanks to Benjamin Turtel's offerings, accelerates their roadmap significantly (00:08:15). They inquired about the time needed to stand up a system, with Benjamin Turtel estimating days for a first cut if the data is clean and ready to go (00:12:44). James Young confirmed that the project, including the model and weights, is planned to be entirely open source and decentralized (00:14:33).
DAO Vision and Scaling Trust James Young described the thrust of the project as creating an organization where members can trust agents to help lead or contribute to proposals and direction, serving as a new form of hybrid organization (00:15:36) (00:17:48). The goal is to build soft trust and reputation, which they acknowledge will be imperfect initially, through coherence among digital twins, leading to DAO coherence and ultimately, AGI. Benjamin Turtel recognized the robust network James Young is building, which should scale as the AI scales (00:16:30) (00:20:47).
Collaboration Details and Next Steps James Young explained that AI6Z is building the first agent for the simulation, and the team is working to abstract the current lag by allowing interaction via slash commands in Discord (00:16:30). Benjamin Turtel clarified that they would need example data showing the input prompt and the desired predicted output for the model (00:11:41). James Young agreed to send these requirements and confirmed they would be using a single model that incorporates context and attestations for individual users, rather than training a separate model for each user (00:22:00). Benjamin Turtel sent relevant links and proposed setting up more time to work on the project (00:10:43) (00:23:23).
